    "1": """Every day this week, hundreds of visitors to the National Gallery in London have marveled at “After Impressionism” — an acclaimed exhibition examining how, at the turn of the 20th century, painters including Van Gogh, Cézanne and Picasso pushed art in bold new directions.

So, too, have art lovers visiting an institution 1,700 miles away: the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, in Moscow.
    
Before Russia invaded Ukraine, the two museums were collaborating on a single “After Impressionism” show, which would bring together masterpieces from each institution’s vast museum holdings. The exhibition was to open in London and then travel to Moscow. Now the shows are divorced; the National Gallery’s version of Cézanne’s “Bathers” will be seen only in London, while Henri Matisse’s “The Pink Studio,” a major painting of bright color and vivid decoration from 1911, will stay put in Moscow.

Over the past year, the National Gallery’s curators searched worldwide for paintings and sculptures to replace the 15 masterpieces that had been expected from Russia. The Pushkin’s curators, in turn, refocused its “After Impressionism,” which opened on Tuesday, toward Russian artists. Last year, Olga Lyubimova, Russia’s culture minister, said it was vital that exhibitions that had been planned with foreign museums went ahead, even when those museums now refused to loan works to Russia.

At a time when Western opera houses and concert halls are grappling with whether to resume work with Russian singers and musicians, the bifurcated “After Impression” exhibition shows that Western museums are holding firm in deciding to cut off Russian state institutions until the war is over. Although phone calls between colleagues on both sides continue, Russian museums are otherwise sealed off from Western influences and partnerships.

In recent statements, Russia’s culture ministry has downplayed the impact of isolation, and trumpeted potential cultural collaborations with nations that have not condemned the war, including China, Oman, and even Cuba.

MaryAnne Stevens, the lead curator of the National Gallery’s “After Impressionism,” said in an interview that the situation felt like a throwback to the 1970s, when Westerners struggled to borrow from Russia’s incredible collections of art and were hampered in academic research. “It’s deeply depressing and very saddening,” she said.

That sense of Russia being shut off has only grown in recent weeks as the government changed the leadership at several of Moscow’s biggest museums, pushing out directors that promoted joint projects with Western institutions.

Last month, Marina Loshak, the Pushkin’s longtime director and a driving force behind the joint “After Impressionism” show, resigned after 10 years in the role.

In a statement on the Puskin’s social media accounts, she said it was time for a new director “to come with new energy, with new thoughts and with new ambitions.” But to many in Russia, Loshak’s position had become untenable because her daughter, Anna Mongayt, is an opposition journalist who opposes the war. Loshak said in an interview with The Art Newspaper Russia that she wanted to leave the Pushkin on her own terms. Loshak was replaced by Elizaveta Likhacheva, previously the head of Russia’s Shchusev Museum of Architecture.

In February, there was a similar changing of the guard at the State Tretyakov Gallery, another of Moscow’s major museums, when the culture ministry announced the abrupt dismissal of Zelfira Tregulova, the Tretyakov Gallery’s steadfastly independent director since 2015. She was replaced by Elena Pronicheva, who previously ran the Polytechnic Museum, a science collection, in Moscow.

Under Tregulova’s leadership, the Tretyakov Gallery staged or hosted several surprising contemporary art shows — including one that celebrated diversity and European unity — and lent works from its collection across Europe. In January, the ministry wrote to the museum urging it to do more to promote “traditional Russian spiritual and moral values,” according to a report in The Moscow Times. A few weeks later, the ministry decided not to renew Tregulova’s contract. Tregulova told reporters she learned of the decision in the press.
    
Both Loshak and Tregulova turned down interview requests for this article; the Pushkin and Tretyakov museums did not respond to similar requests.

Catherine Phillips, a British art historian who had worked with the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg since the 1990s, said in an interview that although the changes were stark, they seemed more about the government wanting to show its power over cultural life, rather than seeking to alter the museums’ content or “micromanage the culture.”

Yet there has been a more patriotic turn in the past decade in some of Russia’s museums, particularly its military and historical institutions. Over the past year, Lyubimova, the culture minister, has visited and praised several such shows, including a Moscow exhibition venerating Russia’s warrior saints. The show had perhaps been conceived “in a completely different setting, with a different message,” she said, according to a news release, but it was “all the more providential to open this exhibition today.”

Of all of Russia’s museums, the Hermitage — founded in the 18th century by Catherine the Great, a German princess who became Russia’s empress — has had the greatest ties to Western Europe. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Hermitage recalled numerous loans, including Fabergé eggs at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, paintings at the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris and a Picasso portrait from an Italian museum.

The Hermitage’s director, Mikhail Piotrovsky, remains in place. The museum’s head since 1990, Piotrovsky is close to President Vladimir Putin of Russia and has made statements backing Russia’s invasion. Last year, in an interview with a Russian newspaper, Piotrovsky, said he felt “stabbed in the back” when foreign museums cut ties with his institution.

In an emailed statement, Piotrovsky said “the blockade of Russia’s museums” had forced the museum to change how it operates. “We have been looking into the opportunities for holding exhibitions from private collections and from friendly countries,” he said.

With fewer international tourists, the museum is pivoting to maintain its global presence. Piotrovsky said the Hermitage was becoming more active online, a move that includes offering virtual museum tours. In March, the museum began broadcasting live feeds from webcams trained on of two of its greatest modern masterpieces — Matisse’s “Dance” and “Music” — so that art lovers outside Russia could still see them.

The museum would also work outside Russia by hosting events in Asia, the Middle East and the Balkans, Piotrovsky said, but did not explain what those would involve.

Officially, Russia’s museums may now be looking Eastward, but Vladimir Opredelenov, a former deputy director at the Pushkin Museum, who left after Russia’s invasion, said in an email interview that Western and Russian museums were still collaborating, just in “more veiled and bizarre forms” rather than via official channels.

Once the war’s over, “we will see that museums will be among the first to set an example” and resume cultural exchange, he added, because “both sides equally understand the value of maintaining human relationships.”

Until then, Opredelenov said, Russian museums need to work with countries in the Middle East and Asia to help spread their creativity: “I hope that the world community understands and accepts this.”

    "2": """ The stoops of brownstone Brooklyn, on which residents routinely leave freebies for passers-by, are a reliable metric of current literary tastes — and distastes. In that fervid summer of 2018 when prominent men were being publicly accused of bad behavior right and left, I found there juxtaposed Woody Allen’s “Side Effects” and Garrison Keillor’s “Lake Wobegon Days,” amusing in a way those humorists never intended. Nearby, someone had huffily discarded a copy of Mario Batali’s “Molto Italiano.” My shelf of scandal was getting more stuffed than one of his delectable vongole origanate.

Over on the West Coast, in Seattle, the author Claire Dederer had discovered a similar phenomenon: a Little Free Library “absolutely crammed to its tiny rafters with books by and about” Allen, which she decided to gather as research. “An ill-gotten Woody Allen book was a book I hadn’t paid for — the perfect way to consume the art of someone whose morals you question,” she writes in her own new book, “Monsters: A Fan’s Dilemma,” a cross-disciplinary consideration of such polarizing figures, and of the ethics of a creative life.

“Everyone alive,” Dederer writes, “is either canceled or about to be canceled.” But she has no use for the term “cancel culture,” privileging, as it does, the person shamed by the red stamp of accusation, rather than the one who pipes up about wrongdoing. And she nonetheless wants to find a way to reconcile her appreciation of great art with the real-life misdeeds of its creators.

Expanding on a popular essay published in The Paris Review a month after the exposure of Harvey Weinstein’s sexual predation, “Monsters” sustains an essayistic, sometimes aphoristic tone throughout 250-odd pages. Dotted with details of her particular milieu — the ferryboat, the crepe shop, the rock show that leaves glitter in the eyelashes — “Monsters” is part memoir, part treatise and all treat. Dederer is continually trying — not in the adjectival sense, but as the present participle: showing us her thought process, correcting as she goes and experimenting with different forms.

She renders an argument with an unnamed tweedy “male writer” about Allen’s 1979 movie “Manhattan,” for example, as a “little play” set in the marble-lined restaurant at the Met Breuer (itself an echt “Manhattan” setting), observing “a clink of silverware around the room, as if the knives and forks were having another conversation, a clearer and cleaner conversation, underneath or above the meaty human rumble.”

Dederer, the “female writer” — and a nimble, witty one — has come to believe that the nonchalance with which Allen’s character dates a high schooler ruins the film, which has always faintly disturbed her, especially since the director left Mia Farrow for her daughter Soon-Yi Previn. The male writer takes the New Critical position that she should judge “Manhattan” just on aesthetics, and that it’s a masterpiece.

Woody Allen has already taken up too much space in this review. The so-called monster — a term that, handily, can denote success and size as well as deviance — has a way of doing that.

Dederer flips through an entire rogues’ gallery, which includes plenty of men yet also a surprising number of women: J.K. Rowling, of course, whose Harry Potter series had enraptured Dederer’s family before she spoke about transgender issues; but also Virginia Woolf, whose diaries were “pocked” with “flippant antisemitic remarks” though she was married to a Jew; Willa Cather, who dehumanized Black people in “My Ántonia”; Laura Ingalls Wilder, who dehumanized Native Americans in the “Little House” series; and Doris Lessing, who left two children behind when she moved from Rhodesia to London with the third.

“This is what female monstrousness looks like: abandoning the kids. Always,” declares Dederer, a mother of two still feeling guilty about a decade of drinking and a five-week retreat to Marfa, Texas. Here I’d argue with her (and I don’t think she’d mind; she is continually arguing with herself). Unless not having children, like Woolf, constitutes a kind of abandonment?

“Monster” turns out to be but one of several words the author carefully palpates, finding it “male, testicular, old world. It’s a hairy word, and has teeth.” It conjures childhood fear and fantasy, like the creatures in “Where the Wild Things Are,” whose author, Maurice Sendak, is in some quarters absurdly demonized, or the works of Roald Dahl: less absurdly demonized, for unflippant antisemitism. (“If we give up the antisemites,” remarks one of Dederer’s friends in what is actually kind of a Woody Allenish joke, “we’ll have to give up everyone.” )

“Am I a Monster?” Dederer titles one chapter, assessing her own relative rectitude. In the next breath, she assesses her own career — she has published well-received books on yoga and sex — “maybe I’m not monstrous enough.” Art requires selfishness; geniuses get a “hall pass” on having to conform to society’s expectations. If only one could keep the passionate, voracious part of monsterdom without leaving teeth marks in other people.

“Stain” is another piece of vocabulary Dederer finds useful, though Philip Roth’s “The Human Stain” is not among the many works analyzed here, and Roth is mentioned only in passing, despite the very interesting case of sexual misconduct accusations against his biographer that has jeopardized Roth’s legacy.

Maybe that’s because “biography,” to Dederer, seems not so much noble genre as ubiquitous nuisance, a “disrupter of my own pleasure”: just a set of personal details you can search for on that most monstrous of modern entities, the internet. “We swim in biography; we are sick with biography,” she writes. It “used to be something you sought out, yearned for, actively pursued. Now it falls on your head all day long.”

Corollary to the “monster,” more passive, is the “stain”: some ugliness coloring someone’s life that you don’t want to know, that nonetheless spreads and can ruin perception of his or her work. Stains seep through time, to the people who hurt the artist and the people the artist hurt, and in these days of heightened parasocial relationships, the people he or she hurts include us: the fan who knew too much.

Every fan’s shelf of scandal, the books  snatched furtively off the stoop, looks different. Dederer’s: light on Roth, laden with Vladimir Nabokov. Her exquisitely reasoned vindication of “Lolita” brought tears of gratitude to my eyes.

But I also found myself disagreeing with or questioning a lot, resisting her sweeping “we” (a pronoun she herself interrogates). I don’t think of the comedian Michael Richards’s 2006 racist tirade every time I catch glimpses of him bursting through the door on “Seinfeld.” (Should I?) Neither, presumably, does the hilarious young comedian Troy Bond, who regularly does a modernized parody of the show on TikTok.

I don’t think the word “ambition” attached to a woman is pejorative anymore. I don’t think women who complete their work — “finishers,” Dederer calls them — are in any way monstrous or comparable to male predators. They’re A students! Or just being professional.

And I definitely don’t think, as she asserts, that “pregnancy is the end of narrative.” This from someone who spends pages luxuriating guiltily in “Rosemary’s Baby,” trying to solve “the problem of Roman Polanski.”  What about John Updike’s “Couples”? (Don’t get me started on how The London Review of Books monsterized Updike, above Patricia Lockwood’s essay, as a “malfunctioning sex robot.”)

For an author who rightly shudders over the cheapening of the word “obsessed” to use the phrases “make work” — the new “make love”? — and “late capitalism” leaves me feeling, as Dederer would herself put it, “a little urpy.”

But, but … this is a book that looks boldly down the cliff at the roiling waters below and jumps right in, splashes around playfully, isn’t afraid to get wet. How refreshing.

    "3":""" On a recent sunny morning on the banks of the Adda River in northern Italy, schoolchildren on a class trip to Imbersago — the “Town of the Ferry of Leonardo da Vinci” — gathered next to a moored boat and listened as a guide explained how the flights of the river’s birds, the formations of its rocks and the workings of its ships inspired Leonardo’s genius.

“Why doesn’t it move?” one of the students interrupted, pointing to the ferry, which sat behind a chain and a sign reading, “Service suspended.” It looked like a deserted summer deck atop two rowboats.

“The water needs to be high enough for the current to move it,” answered Sara Asperti, 45. “Also, they’re looking for a new ferryman. So if any of you are interested.”

Since at least 500 years ago, when the opposing banks of the Adda belonged to the Duchy of Milan and the Republic of Venice, ferries have run on water currents and a taut rope above a narrow stretch of the river. Leonardo spent a lot of time in the area and sketched the motorless ferry around 1513. Later, the invention of the ferry, or its improvement, was attributed to him, though locals say no one knows for sure.

In the past century, reproductions of the original ferries have linked Italy’s Lecco and Bergamo Provinces, allowing knitwear factory workers to commute, a young Pope John XXIII to visit a favorite shrine and, more recently, tourists and cyclists to enjoy the nature paths and yellow fields of rapeseed.

But a year after Italy’s worst drought in seven decades — when much of Europe gasped for precipitation — a winter without much rain or snow has turned into a dry spring across the country’s north. In Piedmont, water tanks are already supplying a small mountain village with drinking water. The Po River valley, usually lush and rich in rice, is parched. In March, a member of Parliament brandished river stones that he collected from the dry Adige River to accuse Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of inaction.

“I’m not Moses,” she responded.

This month, the government established a task force to tackle the scarcity of rainfall, which has also hit the Adda, where swans glide on water so low that islands have emerged, rowboats are beached and the last of what the town calls “Leonardesque” ferries has become a stationary landmark.

“If it becomes a monument, or something static, it loses its meaning,” said Fabio Vergani, Imbersago’s mayor, as he sat on the ferry, big enough to hold three cars or scores of people, but now empty. The boat was a tourist draw and an economic engine, he said, but more important, it was “the family jewel of the town — we cannot be left without it.”

The painful case of the ferry, the mayor said, was “evidence of a global problem.” He continued: “It’s not science fiction. We are feeling the real effects. What was the problem of North Africa is maybe going to be the reality of southern Europe. A lack of rain and desertification of the territory.”

But some of the townspeople say an Italian problem more daunting than climate change is the real culprit for the ferry’s immobility since May.

“Bureaucracy,” said John Codara, who owns the gelato shop next to the ferry.

Since the last ferry operators left to run a more lucrative water taxi in Lake Como, no one has bid to take over the 4,500-euro-a-year concession, even though the town has thrown in a mountain bike rental as a deal sweetener.

The mayor says no one wants to operate the ferry because it cannot function with weak currents, and tried to explain as much to Mr. Codara in his cafe. But the gelato maker wasn’t buying it. After the mayor left, Mr. Codara, who fielded calls from interested locals — “You should see the hair on this guy,” he said, cupping the phone — remained convinced that the engineering of the ferry could handle low water.

“I mean Leonardo wasn’t a moron,” he said, under a framed picture of Leonardo. He demonstrated how the ferry worked on a small wooden model made by a local pensioner — “It’s to scale; it’s worth 500 euros,” or nearly $550, and argued that low water and weak currents meant operators required elbow grease to move it across the cable connecting the two banks.

“The force of the ferry is these,” Mr. Codara said, pointing at his biceps.

What they did not need was an advanced nautical degree, he said, as he marched out of his cafe and made a beeline for a sign honoring “The Human Face of the Ferry” and its pilots over the past century. “Harvard, Harvard, Harvard,” Mr. Codara said with derision as he pointed at the names. “They all went to Harvard.”

Roberto Spada, 75, whose father was one of those ferrymen, said he helped navigate the ferry as a 12-year-old and was interested in helping out the town by doing it again as a volunteer.

“I thought with my license I could do it,” Mr. Spada told the mayor as they leaned against other signs posted next to the ferry that featured both Leonardo’s sketch and an excerpt from Dante’s “Inferno” about Charon, “ferryman of the damned.”

A retired truck driver and president of the local fishing association — which has the ferry as its logo — Mr. Spada had a boating license but seemed bewildered as the mayor explained all of the certifications and bureaucratic hoops that needed to be jumped through to pilot the ferry.

“It’s a really long process,” said Mr. Vergani, the mayor.

In the meantime, the river is at one of its lowest depths in decades.

Volunteers tending to flower beds along the riverbank were finding the dirt so dry that they put down their hoes and used a leaf blower to tidy up. Cyclists stepped over the chain, their biking shoes clicking on the ferry platform, to commiserate about the low level of the river. One of them, Roberto Valsecchi, 63, who recalled crossing with his car on the ferry as a teenager, worried that the paltry snowfall on the ski slopes this winter meant “we will suffer this summer.”

Mr. Vergani worried that even if the skies opened, officials at Lake Como, which fed the river, would hoard the water and “keep the tap closed” to ensure the lake’s own survival. The situation looked bleak. The area’s hydroelectric plants had already started rationing water.

Giuseppina Di Paola, 64, paused from feeding geese to talk about how she used to take her mountain bike on the ferry, but now walked along the banks, where “I found a lot of dead fish.”

Flavio Besana, 70, an environmental guard of the local park, was spending his day off walking the centuries-old path beside the river. He pointed to the boulders considered the inspiration for the landscape in Leonardo’s “Virgin of the Rocks.”

“All of that is usually covered with water,” Mr. Besana said, pointing at the bottom of the boulder. “In 40 years, I’ve never seen the river like this.”

Near Imbersago’s small town center, the roundabout is adorned with a large wooden model of the ferry. The loss of the main attraction means tourism on the weekdays has slowed to a trickle. Valentino Riva, 66, whose father was a ferryman in the 1970s, ironed shirts in the dry-cleaning shop off the main square and recalled more buoyant days.

“There used to be people in the piazza,” he said, as the iron hissed. “Those times are finished.”

Evening fell and the day’s gentle breeze died down, leaving the river as still as a tar pit. Across the water, on the Bergamo side, Angela Maestroni, 64, sat with her husband next to Leonardo da Vinci Street and in front of the small port where the ferry no longer goes. They reminisced about commuting on the ferry, watched the birds and fretted about the future.

“It’s months that it doesn’t rain,” she said. “The summers are so much hotter. Last year, the sun burned everything.”

Just then, a light drizzle fell from the sky, pockmarking the river and spotting the ferry platform on the other shore. Then, just as suddenly, it stopped and the sky cleared.

“It’s two drops,” she said. “It’s not enough.”

    "4" : """ When Brian Maracle returned in his mid-40s to the Mohawk community near Toronto that he had left when he was just 5, he didn’t have a job and knew almost no one there.

But perhaps the biggest challenge facing him was that he neither spoke nor understood much Kanyen’keha, the Mohawk language. More than a century of attempts by Canada’s government to stamp out Indigenous cultures had left Mr. Maracle and many other Indigenous people without their languages.

Now, 30 years later, Mr. Maracle has become a champion of Mohawk, and is helping revive it and other Indigenous languages, both in Canada and elsewhere, through his transformation of teaching methods.

“I never studied linguistics, don’t have any teacher training, my parents weren’t speakers,” he said in his office at an adult language school he founded about two decades ago in his community, the Six Nations of the Grand River territory, southwest of Toronto. Yet, linguistics academic conferences now feature him as a speaker.
Innovative approaches like Mr. Maracle’s are crucial, experts say, to overcoming the suppression of Indigenous languages and cultures in Canada.

From the 19th century into the 1990s, thousands of Indigenous students were taken from their homes, sometimes by force, and placed into Canada’s residential schools system. There, they were forbidden from speaking their languages and from practicing their traditions in what a national commission later characterized as “cultural genocide.”

The system failed to entirely eradicate Indigenous languages, but its effect was nevertheless devastating for the 60 Indigenous languages found in Canada.

Today restoring Indigenous languages has been a component of Canada’s push for reconciliation with its Indigenous people, a top priority of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government. Four years ago, the government passed the Indigenous Languages Act, which formally recognizes the importance of these languages and requires the allocation of money — more than 700 million Canadian dollars to date — for teaching them.

But none of that was around when Mr. Maracle arrived at Six Nations, and the program that was available, he found, was ill-suited for adult students.

“Indigenous languages are extremely different from English,” said Ivona Kucerova, the director of the Center for Advanced Research in Experimental and Applied Linguistics at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. “But typically what you see is that the local Indigenous language teaching methodologies are designed to teach Western languages.”

Mr. Maracle said the problem with his first, unsuccessful lesson was that the instructors, generally Mohawk elders without training as language teachers, were tossing out “whole words.”

“They just expected by dropping a word on you and saying it louder that you’d somehow figure it out,” Mr. Maracle said. “They didn’t understand how the language really is structured.”

A small grant allowed Mr. Maracle and three other people from Six Nations to try to determine exactly what that structure was.

Mr. Maracle found the answer about 25 years ago in the office of David Kanatawakhon-Maracle, no direct relation, a lecturer at the Western University in London, Ontario.

“There were little bits of paper all over this big table,” Mr. Maracle recalled. The lecturer told Mr. Maracle words he had been longing to hear: “He said: ‘I think I’ve got a new way of teaching the language.’”

There were about 60 slips of paper on his office table, and they “were the Rosetta Stone of all the things that you need to be a competent beginning speaker,” Mr. Maracle said.

Kanyen’keha is a polysynthetic language, where a single word can function as an entire sentence. Those words are made up of morphemes, small elements that change their meaning depending on how they are combined.

The slips of paper contained the morphemes, which are the building blocks for the entire language.

“This was huge,” Mr. Maracle said.

Understanding that these elements were the key to unlocking the language was the breakthrough Mr. Maracle needed to attain fluency. But other students at the school he helped start in 1999 were still struggling. It became apparent that someone needed to build a curriculum and teaching program around the morphemes, including a color-coded system for grouping them, which Mr. Maracle did through trial and error.

One essential discovery was figuring out that learning Kanyen’keha requires “looking at the world with Mohawk language eyes,” he said.

In comparison with other languages, Kanyen’keha relies heavily on verbs. Objects are generally described by what they do. The word for “computer,” for example, roughly translates as “it brings things up.”

So its speakers, Mr. Maracle said, need to analyze the world in terms of action rather than objects.

“We don’t teach you how to say “pencil,” “chair,” ”shoe” for six months,” Mr. Maracle said. “Because the language is a verb-based language, the names of things are less grammatically important.”

Prof. Kucerova, the director of the linguistics center in Hamilton, regards Mr. Maracle as a linguist despite his lack of formal training. She said tests showed that his students emerged with a university-level fluidity in two years.

“I have never seen anyone else bring adult learners to that level of language, to be able to speak at this level after two years,” she said, adding that Mohawk ranks with Arabic in terms of difficulty for English-speaking students. “That’s really astonishing.”

“I became literally mesmerized by the extent of his work,” Prof. Kucerova said. “ He’s figured out this improbable, but linguistically extremely smart, method of delivering this radically different language to adults.”

Born in Detroit, Mr. Maracle spent most of his first five years in Six Nations, but later in his childhood lived in Buffalo and Rochester in New York, and Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, as his father, a carpenter, moved for work.

After graduating from Dartmouth College, he studied journalism and worked as a reporter for The Globe and Mail newspaper. He was also the host of an Indigenous radio program for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation before moving back to Six Nations.

Mr. Maracle, 76, recently retired from the language school he founded — Onkwawenna Kentyohkwa, or Our Language Society — but he remains active in a number of its programs.

The school has its offices in an Indigenous community services building in the village of Ohsweken, Ontario, the sprawling First Nation’s administrative center. It can afford to accept only about a dozen students a year; its first grants from the federal government arrived just in 2021. Before then, it was largely financed by the community.

There are no concrete figures of current Kanyen’keha speakers in the area, but the local branch of the Royal Bank of Canada, Canada’s largest financial institution, now has signs in Kanyen’keha and employees who speak the language. Signs in the language around the community warn motorists to not text and drive.

The school’s students have included Marc Miller, the current federal minister of Indigenous relations, who after some part time studies, became the first lawmaker to address Canada’s Parliament in an Indigenous language since Confederation in 1867.

Mr. Maracle said the most important difference he has seen is that Kanyen’keha is no longer spoken only by older people, but used more often by the young, in their homes, with their immediate families and in everyday situations.

“I think people are finally coming around to the realization that the public schools and technology are not going to save our languages,” he said, adding, “You have to enable young adults to become speakers so that they can raise children as first language speakers.”

    "5" : """ Oh, Possums, Dame Edna is no more.

To be unflinchingly precise, Barry Humphries, the Australian-born actor and comic who for almost seven decades brought that divine doyenne of divadom, Dame Edna Everage, to delirious, dotty, disdainful Dadaist life, died on Saturday in Sydney. He was 89.

His death was confirmed by the hospital where he had spent several days after undergoing hip surgery. In a tribute message posted on Twitter, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia praised Mr. Humphries as “a great wit, satirist, writer and an absolute one-of-kind.”

A stiletto-heeled, stiletto-tongued persona who might well have been the spawn of a ménage à quatre involving Oscar Wilde, Salvador Dalí, Auntie Mame and Miss Piggy, Dame Edna was not so much a character as a cultural phenomenon, a force of nature trafficking in wicked, sequined commentary on the nature of fame.

For generations after the day she first sprang to life on the Melbourne stage, Dame Edna reigned, bewigged, bejeweled and bejowled, as one of the longest-lived characters to be channeled by a single performer. She toured worldwide in a series of solo stage shows and was ubiquitous on television in the United States, Britain, Australia and elsewhere.

A master improviser (many of Dame Edna’s most stinging barbs were ad-libbed) with a face like taffy, Mr. Humphries was widely esteemed as one of the world’s foremost theatrical clowns.

“I’ve only seen one man have power over an audience like that,” the theater critic John Lahr told him, after watching Dame Edna night after night in London. “My father.” Mr. Lahr’s father was the great stage and cinematic clown Bert Lahr.

Mr. Humphries conceived Edna in 1955 as Mrs. Norm Everage, typical Australian housewife. “Everage,” after all, is Australian for “average.”

Housewife, Superstar, National Treasure

But Edna soon became a case study in exorbitant amour propre, lampooning suburban pretensions, political correctness and the cult of celebrity, and acquiring a damehood along the way. A “housewife-superstar,” she called herself, upgrading the title in later years to “megastar” and, still later, to “gigastar.”

In Britain, where Mr. Humphries had long made his home, Dame Edna was considered a national treasure, a paragon of performance art long before the term was coined.

In the United States, she starred in a three-episode series, “Dame Edna’s Hollywood,” a mock celebrity talk show broadcast on NBC in the early 1990s, and was a frequent guest on actual talk shows.

She performed several times on Broadway, winning Mr. Humphries a special Tony Award, as well as Drama Desk and Theater World Awards, for “Dame Edna: The Royal Tour,” his 1999 one-person show.

In her stage and TV shows, written largely by Mr. Humphries, Dame Edna typically made her entrance tottering down a grand staircase (Mr. Humphries was more than six feet tall) in a tsunami of sequins, her hair a bouffant violet cloud (she was “a natural wisteria,” she liked to say), her evening gown slit to the thigh to reveal Mr. Humphries’s surprisingly good legs, her body awash in jewels, her eyes agape behind sprawling rhinestone glasses (“face furniture,” she called them).

Addressing the audience, she delivered her signature greeting, “Hellooooo, Possums!”

By turns tender and astringent, Dame Edna called audience members “possums” often. She also called them other things, as when, leaning across the footlights, she would address a woman in the front row in a confiding, carrying voice: “I know, dear. I used to make my own clothes, too.”

Performances concluded with Dame Edna flinging hundreds of gladioli into the crowd, no mean feat aerodynamically. “Wave your gladdies, Possums!” she exhorted audience members who caught them, and the evening would end, to music, with a mass valedictory swaying.

Between the “Hellooooo” and the gladdies, Dame Edna’s audiences were treated to a confessional monologue deliciously akin to finding oneself stranded in a hall of vanity mirrors.

There was commentary on her husband and children (“I made a decision: I put my family last”); her beauty regimen (“Good self-esteem is very important. I look in the mirror and say, ‘Edna, you are gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous’”); and the constellation of luminaries who routinely sought her counsel, among them Queen Elizabeth II and her family. (“I’ve had to change my telephone number several times to stop them ringing me.”)

Dame Edna’s TV shows were often graced by actual celebrity guests, including Zsa Zsa Gabor, Charlton Heston, Sean Connery, Robin Williams and Lauren Bacall.

They came in for no less of a drubbing than the audience did, starting with the inaugural affront, the affixing of immense name tags to their lapels — for eclipsed by the light of gigastardom so close at hand, who among us would not be reduced to anonymity?

“Chuck,” Mr. Heston’s name tag read. Ms. Gabor received two: a “Zsa” for the right shoulder and a “Zsa” for the left.

A few pleasantries were exchanged before Dame Edna moved in for the kill.

“You’ve had nine hits this year,” she purred fawningly at the singer-songwriter Michael Bolton on one of her British TV shows. “On your website.”

Turning to the audience after delivering a particularly poisonous insult, she would ooze, “I mean that in the most caring way.”

Those guests who emerged relatively unscathed had the savvy to take Dame Edna at face value and interact with her as though she were real. The moment he donned those rhinestone glasses, Mr. Humphries often said, Dame Edna became real to him too, an entirely separate law unto herself.

‘I Wish I’d Thought of That’

“I’m, as it were, in the wings, and she’s onstage,” he explained in a 2015 interview with Australian television. “And every now and then she says something extremely funny, and I stand there and think, ‘I wish I’d thought of that.’”

But the truly funny thing, Possums, is that when Mr. Humphries first brought Dame Edna to life, he intended her to last only a week or so. What was more, she was meant to have been played by the distinguished actress Zoe Caldwell.

Mr. Humphries created a string of other characters over the years, notably the boorish, bibulous Australian cultural attaché Sir Les Patterson. But it was Dame Edna, the outlandish aunt who engenders adoration and mortification in equal measure, who captivated the public utterly — despite the fact that in later years, her mortification-inducing lines sometimes landed her, and her creator, in trouble.

So fully did Mr. Humphries animate Edna that he was at continued pains to point out that he was neither a female impersonator in the conventional sense nor a cross-dresser in any sense.

“Mr. Humphries, do you ever have to take your children aside and explain to them why you like to wear women’s clothes?” an American interviewer once asked him.

“If I were an actor playing Hamlet,” he replied, “would I have to take my children aside and say I wasn’t really Danish?’”

By all accounts far more erudite than Dame Edna — he was an accomplished painter, bibliophile and art collector — Mr. Humphries, in a sustained act of self-protection, always spoke of her in the third person.

She did likewise. “My manager,” she disdainfully called him. (She also called Mr. Humphries “a money-grubbing little slug” and accused him of embezzling her fortune. He did, it must be said, cash a great many of her checks.)

But as dismissive of her creator as Dame Edna was, she rallied to his aid when he very likely needed her most: after years of alcoholism culminated in stays in psychiatric hospitals and at least one brush with the law.

‘I Hated Her’

John Barry Humphries was born in Kew, a Melbourne suburb, on Feb. 17, 1934. His father, Eric, was a prosperous builder; his mother, Louisa, was a homemaker.

From his earliest childhood in Camberwell, a more exclusive suburb, he felt oppressed by the bourgeois conformism that enveloped his parents and their circle, and depressed by his mother’s cold suburban propriety.

Dame Edna was a response to those forces.

“I invented Edna because I hated her,” Mr. Humphries was quoted as saying in Mr. Lahr’s book “Dame Edna Everage and the Rise of Western Civilization: Backstage With Barry Humphries” (1992). “I poured out my hatred of the standards of the little people of their generation.”

Dame Edna emerged when the young Mr. Humphries, under the sway of Dadaism, was performing with a repertory company based at the University of Melbourne; he had dropped out of the university two years before.

On long bus tours, he entertained his colleagues with the character of Mrs. Norm Everage — born Edna May Beazley in Wagga Wagga, Australia, sometime in the 1930s — an ordinary housewife who had found sudden acclaim after winning a nationwide competition, the Lovely Mother Quest.

Unthinkable as it seems, Edna was dowdy then, given to mousy brown hair and pillbox hats. But she was already in full command of the arsenal of bourgeois bigotries that would be a hallmark of her later self.

For a revue by the company in December 1955, Mr. Humphries wrote a part for Edna, earmarked for Ms. Caldwell, an Australian contemporary. But when she proved too busy to oblige, he donned a dress and played it himself. After Edna proved a hit with Melbourne audiences, he performed the character elsewhere in the country.

By the end of the 1950s, hoping to make a career as a serious actor, Mr. Humphries had moved to London, where Edna met with little enthusiasm and was largely shelved. (She blamed Mr. Humphries ever after for her lack of early success there.)

Mr. Humphries played Mr. Sowerberry, the undertaker, in the original West End production of the musical “Oliver!” in 1960, and reprised the role when the show came to Broadway in 1963.

But though he worked steadily during the ’60s, he was also in the fierce grip of alcoholism. Stays in psychiatric hospitals, he later said, were of no avail.

His nadir came in 1970, when he awoke in a Melbourne gutter to find himself under arrest.

With a doctor’s help, Mr. Humphries became sober soon afterward; he did not take a drink for the rest of his life. He dusted off Dame Edna and, little by little, de-dowdified her. By the late ’70s, with celebrity culture in full throttle, she had given him international renown and unremitting employment.

Edna did not seduce every critic. Reviewing her first New York stage show, the Off Broadway production “Housewife! Superstar!!,” in The New York Times in 1977, Richard Eder called it “abysmal.”

Nor did Edna’s resolute lack of political correctness always stand her, or Mr. Humphries, in good stead. In February 2003, writing an advice column as Dame Edna in Vanity Fair, he replied to a reader’s query about whether to learn Spanish.

“Who speaks it that you are really desperate to talk to?” Dame Edna’s characteristically caustic response read. “The help? Your leaf blower? Study French or German, where there are at least a few books worth reading, or, if you’re American, try English.”

A public furor ensued, led by the Mexican-born actress Salma Hayek, who appeared on the magazine’s cover that month. Vanity Fair discontinued Dame Edna’s column not long afterward.

In an interview with The Times in 2004, Mr. Humphries was unrepentant.

“The people I offended were minorities with no sense of humor, I fear,” he said. “When you have to explain the nature of satire to somebody, you’re fighting a losing battle.”

Mr. Humphries drew further ire after a 2016 interview with the British newspaper The Telegraph in which he denounced political correctness as a “new puritanism.” In the same interview, he described people who transition from male to female as “mutilated” men, and Caitlyn Jenner in particular as “a publicity-seeking ratbag.”

Sailing Above the Fray

Dame Edna, for her part, appeared to sail imperviously through. She returned to Broadway in 2004 for the well-received show “Dame Edna: Back With a Vengeance” and in 2010 with “All About Me,” a revue that also starred the singer and pianist Michael Feinstein.

As herself — it was she, and not Mr. Humphries, who was credited — Dame Edna played the recurring character Claire Otoms (the name is an anagram for “a sitcom role”), an outré lawyer, on the Fox TV series “Ally McBeal.”

Under his own name, Mr. Humphries appeared as the Great Goblin in “The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey” (2012); as the voice of Bruce, the great white shark, in “Finding Nemo” (2003); and in other pictures.

Mr. Humphries’s books include the memoirs “More Please” (1992) and “My Life as Me” (2002) and the novel “Women in the Background” (1995). He was named a Commander of the British Empire in 2007.

Dame Edna also wrote several books, among them “Dame Edna’s Bedside Companion” (1983) and the memoir “My Gorgeous Life” (1989).

Mr. Humphries’s first marriage, to Brenda Wright, ended in divorce, as did his second, to Rosalind Tong, and his third, to Diane Millstead. He had two daughters, Tessa and Emily, from his marriage to Ms. Tong, and two sons, Oscar and Rupert, from his marriage to Ms. Millstead.

The Sydney Morning Herald reported that his survivors include his wife of 30 years, Lizzie Spender, the daughter of the British poet Stephen Spender, as well as his children and 10 grandchildren.

Mr. Humphries continued to perform until last year, when he toured Britain (as himself) with a one-man show, “The Man Behind the Mask.” He returned to Australia in December for Christmas.

Dame Edna’s husband, Norm, a chronic invalid “whose prostate,” she often lamented, “has been hanging over me for years,” died long ago. Her survivors include an adored son, Kenny, who designed all her gowns; a less adored son, Bruce; and a despised daughter, the wayward Valmai. (“She steals things. Puts them in her pantyhose. Particularly frozen chickens when she’s in a supermarket.”)

Another daughter, Lois, was abducted as an infant by a “rogue koala,” a subject Dame Edna could bring herself to discuss with interviewers only rarely.

Though the child was never seen again, to the end of her life Dame Edna never gave up hope she would be found.

“I’m looking,” she told NPR in 2015. “Every time I pass a eucalyptus tree I look up.”

Dear readers,

It was the day I found myself weeping over a purse during the final minutes of “Sex and the City 2,” miles above Omaha, that I came to truly believe in the powers of mild altitude hypoxia. This is, of course, the phenomenon in which the reduced rates of oxygen in flight may result in heightened emotional responses — and I love it. For those of us who find it hard to turn off our brains, whose entire viewing experience can be ruined by a single anachronism or grammatical error, who are tiresome even to ourselves — well, suspending that hectoring critic is a vacation in itself.

And it’s true for books, too! On a recent red-eye, it made sense to sob at the heart-rending conclusion of “Giovanni’s Room”; never has claustrophobia been more freeing than in James Baldwin’s precision-cut classic. But crying when Monroe Boston Strause finally hits upon the formula for chiffon filling in his 1939 memoir, “Pie Marches On”? It may have been cathartic, but it was time for a melatonin. (“Sex and the City 2” is, after all, frame for frame one of the worst movies ever made.)

These books hold up at any altitude.

This Portuguese family-saga-meets-coming-of-age-drama-meets-romance by one of the greatest of the 19th-century realists (just ask Zola!) is incredibly, improbably fun. José Maria de Eça de Queirós was prolific, and all of his work is characterized by a keen eye for human folly and material detail — but this novel is undoubtedly my favorite. Long? Yes, but it’s a page-turner. And Margaret Jull Costa’s 2007 translation renders it a pure bedtime pleasure, its heft a comfort rather than a burden.

As if the multigenerational story of shocking marriages, changing Lisbon mores, high-society affairs and arrogant young gentlemen getting taken down a few pegs were not enough, “The Maias” also features incredibly vivid descriptions of the era’s décor. To wit: “At the end of the corridor lay Alfonso’s study, furnished like a prelate’s chambers in red damasks. Everything in the room — the solid rosewood desk, the low shelves made from carved oak, the sober opulence of the bindings on the books — combined to create an austere air of studious peace, reinforced by a painting attributed to Rubens.”

Roffman’s was the first biography to look closely at the early life of the famously private Ashbery — who, according to conventional wisdom, made a point of avoiding the autobiographical in his poetry. This fluent, engrossing portrait makes a persuasive argument for the importance of youthful influences: the upstate farm and verdant landscape that show up, elliptically, in so much of the poet’s work; the books and music that introduced the precocious teenager to the larger world of art; the death of his beloved brother.

Roffman knew Ashbery, and had access to his childhood journals, his juvenilia and his Deerfield and college archives, so the result is intimate and detailed. She ends the book when Ashbery is in his late 20s and on the verge of success, but that gives us plenty of delicious glimpses into the electric early days of the New York School: his charismatic best friend Frank O’Hara, the surly Beats, the artists and dancers and avant-garde musicians, many of them queer, of bohemian New York — plus O’Hara’s weird Harvard roommate, the seemingly ubiquitous “Ted” Gorey.

It’s a must-read for Ashbery enthusiasts, but you don’t need to love or even like poetry to appreciate this story of growing up in an era when artistic potential felt limitless and the life of the mind was as vivid (almost) as that of Greenwich Village evenings.

Why don’t you …

Do a little spring cleaning? As a penniless young poet in 1970s New York, Bob Rosenthal signed on with a temp agency cleaning houses. But houses, of course, mean people. And people mean feelings, relationships, the unexpected. Rosenthal’s resulting book, “Cleaning Up New York,” is a deeply humane, often hilarious and ultimately moving little treatise on intimacy. As to cleaning tips? Dirt always wins.

Exercise your green thumb? I don’t remember how “The Flower Shop,” a photo book about the gorgeous Viennese florist Blumenkraft, came into my life. But it’s an idiosyncratic commentary on what the subtitle itself terms (endearingly) “charm, grace, beauty, tenderness in a commercial context.” Think of it as a documentary in book form: a glimpse into the life of a business and the people who have devoted their lives to it.

Pull yourself together, damn it? From the legendary grande dame decorator Dorothy Draper — whom one suspects subscribed to the “brisk walk” school of therapeutic treatment — comes a quote I have pinned above my desk for those many days when I’m tempted to be antisocial: “‘The Will to be Dreary’ is a morose little imp which whispers to us that something which we know would be fun would be too much trouble, will take too much time, is too expensive and probably wouldn’t be as amusing after all as just now you think it would be. Now don’t listen to that voice. Tune it out.”

    "7" : """ The Irish podcaster David Chambers spends his days‌ in an exceptionally drab office. A room so drab it is striking. In a recent interview via Zoom, he was dressed to match, in a white T-shirt and plain black hoodie. The only noteworthy thing onscreen was ‌an orange and white plastic bag that Chambers wore over his head. His green eyes, thick eyebrows‌ and beard could be seen through the bag’s holes, but the rest of his face was obscured.

Although they don’t know what he looks like underneath the mask, most people in Ireland know Chambers, 37, by his pseudonym “Blindboy Boatclub,” or, more often, just “Blindboy.” He is best known as the host of “The Blindboy Podcast,” a weekly show in which he discusses eclectic topics, like the unlikely benefits of lion urine or the link between heavy metal and futurism, and tells personal anecdotes that unspool like short stories. He addresses topics like mental health that Irish news media outlets rarely touch, and brings a millennial sensibility to political discussions. His register is earnest and intellectual, but also funny and down-to-earth.

“The Blindboy Podcast,” which Chambers started in 2017, regularly attracts 700,000 to one million monthly listeners, according to Acast, the company that hosts it. Six years on, it is something of a cultural phenomenon in Ireland, and increasingly overseas. Chambers has appeared on some of Ireland’s most popular television chat shows, and President Michael D. Higgins was a guest on a recent podcast episode. Acast says that more than half of the podcast’s listeners are outside Ireland, and Chambers has toured live shows in Canada, Thailand, Spain and Belgium.

Before the podcast, Chambers’s career took several surprising turns. He first used the alias “Blindboy” while making prank calls to radio call-in shows, which earned him some notoriety in Ireland and a cult following there. With a friend and fellow prank caller, Chambers formed a comedy hip-hop duo called the Rubberbandits that had a viral hit in 2010. That track, “Horse Outside,” reached No. 2 in the Irish charts, and Chambers maneuvered that success into hosting comedy shows on MTV and the British station Channel 4.

The plastic bag on Chambers’s head, which dates back to the beginning, was “part of a performance to challenge solemnity in whatever I do,” he said. But it also guarantees anonymity: He is grateful to be spared some of the trappings of fame, particularly in a small country, he said.

“Being an Irish celebrity in itself is a bit cringe — unless you’re Paul Mescal, like, a proper celebrity,” he said. “I don’t want that level of cringe. Being Blindboy in real life would be a very, very cringe existence.”

Anonymity also affords ‌Chambers ‌the freedom to talk candidly on the podcast about his personal struggles with mental health. He tells funny, relatable anecdotes about his experiences with, and efforts to manage, depression, anxiety and agoraphobia. One such episode is titled “Why I’m Going Back to Therapy.”

This openness resonates with his mostly millennial and Gen Z audience. Leah Moloney, a 27-year-old Irish fan who started listening regularly during the pandemic, said in an interview that she found the mental health content “really helpful at that time, because he was speaking really openly, and I certainly felt less alone.”

She added that when Chambers told listeners last April, in an episode called “Intrapersonally Speaking,” that he had been diagnosed with autism, that had helped her adapt to an A.D.H.D. diagnosis she had recently received. “I’ve been inspired by him to be open,” she said, adding that she now posts regularly about her experience of A.D.H.D. on TikTok.

Issues like these are still relatively under-discussed in the Irish news media and society, and Chambers’s fans seem to welcome his candor. He gets “thousands and thousands” of social media messages about mental health, he said, but he could never deal with interactions like those in person. “If I didn’t have the bag,” Chambers said, “I’d stop talking about mental health‌.”

On other episodes, Chambers talks frankly about an economic climate that he says has infantilized his generation. Ireland is in the grips of a rental crisis caused by a severe housing shortage; Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said last month that the country of five million people had 250,000 too few homes. And it is Ireland’s millennials who are worst affected, Chambers said. “The media will call a 40-year-old a young person. I’m in my late 30s and I refuse: I’m middle-aged,” he added. “If you call it ‘middle-aged people can’t get housing,’ it’s obvious there is a problem.”

Chambers said he saw a generational divide, too, in the way that the news media in the Republic of Ireland talks about Northern Irish politics. On the podcast, Chambers addresses millennial perspectives that he says news outlets in the South fail to reflect.

Sinn Fein, a political party that fields candidates on both sides of the border, has had a recent resurgence of popularity in the South, where it was once unpopular because it was associated with the Irish Republican Army. Chambers said the Irish news media continued to draw links between the party and terrorism. But for people born after the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that brokered peace in the North, he said, Sinn Fein lawmakers were “the ones who are doing something different.” (He added that he did not endorse any political parties.)

Several popular Instagram accounts attest to this growing interest in Northern Irish politics among young people in the Republic. One of these, called Tanistry, posts plainly illustrated slides explaining historical events such as the Good Friday Agreement, or the Bloody Sunday massacre of 1972, and relating them to contemporary politics. Andrew Clarke, a 27-year-old college student from Belfast who runs the account, said that there had been a culture of “mystification” around Northern Irish politics and that he was “trying to make it digestible,” adding that more than half of the account’s followers were aged 24 to 35, with the highest concentrations in Dublin and Belfast.

The most interesting thing about the success of “The Blindboy Podcast,” though, is the esoteric and seemingly random nature of many episodes. Where it is common for popular millennial podcasts to attract interest via culture war topics — deliberately courting controversy, or talking mostly about trending social justice issues — Chambers has garnered a huge audience mostly by talking about things that nobody is really supposed to care about.

One episode traces the history of offices back to monks; many others address arcane elements of Irish mythology. “Topographia Hibernica,” a short story collection by Chambers that will be published in Ireland and Britain in November, explores these themes further, looking at the links between mythology and colonialism.

Talking to him can feel like skittering around a galaxy of Wikipedia wormholes (in a good way). There is an infectious quality to his enthusiasm for a seemingly endless, and frequently bizarre, catalog of interests and passions.

Chambers said he put the success of “The Blindboy Podcast” down to the fact he only ever talks about his genuine interests, something he thinks the audience can sense. “I’ll never speak about something just to get listens,” he said.

    "8" : """ Two years into a surge of book bans across the United States, Florida is a hot spot in the clash over what reading material is appropriate for children, with laws that have greatly expanded the state’s ability to restrict books.

Historically, books were challenged one at a time. As bans in schools and libraries began increasing nationally in 2021, efforts were largely local, led by a parent or a group. But over the past year, access to books, particularly those touching on race, gender or sexual orientation, became increasingly politicized. With that came an increase in legislation and regulations in some states and school districts that affected which books libraries could offer.

The shift is particularly evident in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican-controlled Legislature and a rapidly growing network of conservative groups aligned to pass three state laws last year aimed, at least in part, at reading or educational materials. Among the books removed from circulation in one of the state’s school districts are Toni Morrison’s “Beloved,” and Margaret Atwood’s “The Handmaid’s Tale.”

The policies have energized Mr. DeSantis’s supporters and are part of the platform from which he is expected to run for president.
Proponents of the restrictions say their aims are to protect students from inappropriate materials and to give parents more control over their children’s education. In focusing on “parents’ rights,” Mr. DeSantis is trying to build on the popularity he amassed when he resisted Covid-19 restrictions, particularly in schools. The push is a signature part of the conservatism he is showcasing in Florida. His Parental Rights in Education law, for example, constrains instruction on gender and sexuality, which has led some districts to remove books with L.G.B.T.Q. characters.

Some teachers and librarians say the policies are vague, with imprecise language and broad requirements, leading to some confusion. But they are trying to comply. Violation of the law could be a third-degree felony; in general, such crimes are punishable by up to five years in prison

In January, when the new guidelines went into effect, some teachers removed or covered up books that had not been vetted by certified media specialists, whose approval is now legally required. Others are not ordering titles that could draw complaints. Some educators emptied shelves or pulled collections until the titles could be reassessed.

“It is a whole new level of fear,” said Kathleen Daniels, the president of the Florida Association for Media in Education, a professional organization for school librarians and media educators. “There are books that are not being selected because they have been challenged.”

Florida ranks second, behind Texas, as the state with the highest number of book removals, according to a report released on Thursday from the free-speech organization PEN America, which tracked book bans in schools from July 1 to Dec. 31 of 2022. But PEN said that Florida’s broad, state-level approach, with “wholesale bans” that restrict access to “untold numbers of books in classrooms and school libraries,” made the true extent of book removals in the state difficult to quantify.

Many of the new restrictions come from a law passed last year that requires trained media specialists to evaluate each school book to ensure it is age-appropriate and free of “pornographic” content. The law also requires schools to keep a searchable online database of the books in their libraries and classrooms.

Proposed legislation goes further. In March, the Florida House passed a bill that could require schools to remove a book promptly based on a single complaint from a parent or county resident that the book depicted sexual conduct. Under the proposed bill, the book would remain unavailable until the complaint was resolved.

Two other laws are contributing to book bans in Florida schools. The Stop WOKE Act prohibits instruction that could make students feel guilty or responsible for the past actions of other members of their race. The Parents Rights in Education law prohibits classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in some elementary grades; a state rule is expected to expand the restrictions through 12th grade.

Efforts by Florida’s 67 public school districts to put the new regulations into practice have been uneven and often chaotic. Some districts have taken no major action. Others enacted blanket removals that essentially gutted libraries.

Earlier this year, soon after the new guidelines for libraries were issued in January, some districts moved quickly to comply. In Duval County, home to Jacksonville, the public school district restricted access to more than a million titles, keeping them out of students’ hands until they were vetted by specialists. In Manatee County, on Florida’s Gulf Coast, some teachers boxed up their classroom libraries or covered their shelves. Officials in Martin County, on the state’s Atlantic Coast, removed around 150 books from school circulation in January and February, including John Green’s “Looking for Alaska,” and James Patterson’s “Maximum Ride,” a series of sci-fi adventure books for readers ages 10 and up, which were pulled from elementary schools.

Mr. Patterson, who lives in Palm Beach, Fla., called the removal of his books “frightening.”

“When you can take a mainstream series like ‘Maximum Ride’ and take it off the shelves,” he said, “it shows that no one is safe.” A county spreadsheet gave no specific reason for the series’ removal.

Training material advised media specialists to consider how they would feel reading passages from the book in question aloud. “If you would not be comfortable reading the material in a public setting,” said a slide show by the state’s Department of Education, “then you should lean towards not making the material available in a school library for children.”

Jennifer Pippin leads a local chapter of the group Moms for Liberty in Florida and was on the Department of Education panel that helped design the training materials. She said books that had been removed from school libraries in the state should not be considered “banned” because they remained available at public libraries and in bookstores.

Young people in a school library might happen to pick up a book that contains a graphic rape scene, she said, because they enjoyed other volumes in the same series. Or a child interested in penguins might open a book about a penguin family with two dads. But “it may not be appropriate for them per their parents’ standards,” she said. “With no instruction or parental guidance, some of these things could indeed be harmful.”

In Duval County, the school district asked the district’s 54 media specialists in January to begin reviewing the more than 1.6 million titles. Unapproved books, elementary teachers were told, had to be covered or set aside.

About 25,000 books had cleared the review process as of early this month. The ongoing process has left Duval County’s more than 129,000 students with access to only a tiny fraction of available titles, critics said.

“Our books are being shadow-banned,” said Nina Perez, a Jacksonville resident and a director for MomsRising, an advocacy organization opposing the restrictions. “They get mired in an administrative process.”
Tracy Pierce, a Duval school district spokesman, said in an email last month that the actions had followed guidance from the state’s Department of Education. At no time should classrooms have been without reading material, he said, since students still had access to approved books and collections. He acknowledged that “a small number of principals did close or overly restrict” media centers briefly and were advised to restore access.

Mr. DeSantis has reacted aggressively to criticism that public schools are banning books. He dismissed news reports that Duval County schools had removed a title about the baseball player Roberto Clemente as “a joke,” accusing critics of “manufacturing” a narrative about book bans.

The book, which addresses the racism that Mr. Clemente faced, was removed and then restored in February after a review. Last month, the state’s education commissioner named the title, “Roberto Clemente: Pride of the Pittsburgh Pirates” by Jonah Winter, a book of the month for third through fifth grades.

At a news conference last month, Mr. DeSantis stood behind a sign that read “Exposing the Book Ban HOAX” and said that the state was trying to protect children from pornographic material. The event began with a presentation on books reported to districts for removal — including “Gender Queer,” by Maia Kobabe and “Flamer,” by Mike Curato — and highlighted scenes about sexual contact and masturbation.

“This idea of a book ban in Florida, that somehow they don’t want books in the library — that’s a hoax,” Mr. DeSantis said. “And that’s really a nasty hoax, because it’s a hoax in service of trying to pollute and sexualize our children.”

Critics in the state are pushing back. In March, Democracy Forward, an advocacy organization, filed a lawsuit with the state on behalf of the Florida Education Association and other groups challenging the rules, arguing that they censor educators, limit students’ access to books and harm public education. The Florida Freedom to Read Project organized a rally in Tallahassee last month with authors and free speech activists to protest censorship.

After Brian Covey, a substitute teacher in Jacksonville, posted a video in January of empty library shelves at a Duval County middle school, a reporter asked Mr. DeSantis about it. The governor called the video a “fake narrative.” Mr. Covey, who lost his job shortly after, said that he was troubled that Mr. DeSantis and the school district tried to delegitimize what he had documented.

The fact that they called it a false narrative, Mr. Covey said, “tells me that they have no intention of saying, ‘We made a mistake.’”

    "9" : """ Lucinda Williams, the Grammy-winning 70-year-old songwriter, was born in Lake Charles, La. Her grandfathers were both preachers; one was a civil rights advocate. Her father, Miller Williams, was an award-winning poet. Her mother loved music and played the piano. Williams grew up in Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, Utah, Chile and Mexico. On paper, it was an ideal upbringing for the artist she became: a nomadic touring musician whose songs draw on deep Southern roots, using matter-of-fact imagery to conjure tempestuous emotions.

But her pedigree didn’t make her life fall neatly into place, as Williams recalls in her memoir, “Don’t Tell Anybody the Secrets I Told You.” “I’ve held back from talking about my childhood over the decades of my life,” she notes. “I’ve written songs about it instead.”

Williams’s mother was sexually abused as a child, she writes, and lived with schizophrenia and alcoholism. Her poet-professor father was a mentor and protector, but he also had a temper. Williams’s parents divorced after her father took up with one of his teenage students.

In the title song of her best-selling album, “Car Wheels on a Gravel Road,” Williams sings about being a “Child in the back seat ’bout four or five years/Lookin’ out the window, little bit of dirt mixed with tears.” When her father first heard it, he told Williams that she was that crying little girl; until then, Williams hadn’t realized she was writing about herself.

Williams’s memoir is as flinty, earthy and plain-spoken as her songs. She reveals the autobiographical underpinnings of some of her darkest lyrics, but she also tells a larger tale: of artistic determination battling personal insecurity; of misjudging and being misjudged by men and by the music business; and of steadfastly holding her own.

She doesn’t give in: not on a trendy remix, not on her album cover photos, not on her instincts. She can handle being called difficult or “insane” even though, she admits, “There are times when I can bring an extra layer of unpredictable emotion to a situation that is already tough to begin with.” The lasting results are in her songs.

Williams envisioned life as a musician soon after she picked up a guitar. She started performing folk songs in her teens. But even as she honed her own songwriting and built local reputations — in Texas and then in Los Angeles — she worked day jobs well into her 30s. Major labels rejected her, again and again, as being “too country for rock” but “too rock for country.”

From the beginning — two low-budget Folkways albums she made in 1979 and 1980 — Williams sang about elemental subjects: desire, sorrow, love, traveling, survival, death. Some of her songs are kiss-offs; some offer regrets; some are elegies; some are takedowns. They’re always grounded in homely details. In “Hot Blood,” a bluesy outpouring of female lust, she sings about feeling “a cold chill” as she watches a guy just “fixin’ your flat with a tire iron.”

It took an English punk label, Rough Trade, to release “Lucinda Williams,” her 1988 breakthrough album. A decade later, “Car Wheels on a Gravel Road” marked her commercial peak. But recording that album, she recalls in the memoir, was lengthy and fraught. Making records, she writes, “can test the limits and boundaries of everyone involved. I now understand that is normal.”

Getting the sound Williams wanted on “Car Wheels” led to the breakup of her longtime band and clashes with two producers. Then contractual tangles delayed the release of the finished album for two years. Williams also nixed a video concept from the director Paul Schrader, deciding, “He was just another guy trying to impose his vision on a female artist. ‘Car Wheels’ did fine without a video.”

Throughout her book, Williams recognizes her own appetites and mistakes. She writes about suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder and bouts of depression, and she recognizes her weakness for the kind of boyfriend she calls “a poet on a motorcycle,” guys who often turned out to be cheaters, addicts or worse.

She came through anyway. “That relationship was done, but I got a good song out of it,” she writes about one romantic debacle. Williams has been married since 2009 to her manager, producer and songwriting collaborator, Tom Overby.

Although Williams finished her book in 2022, it doesn’t mention her 2020 stroke; she can no longer play guitar. But she returned to touring in 2021 and persists in writing songs; she’s releasing a new album in June. Her memoir shows how deep that grit runs.

    "10" : """ Lucinda Williams has been writing a memoir in song for over 40 years. In her country blues we hear a woman’s equipoise of thinking and feeling, demanding what she deserves, restless and self-possessed. From rambling Southern songwriter to music-industry misfit, from Louisiana to New York and Little Rock to Houston, she sings of working hard. She changes the locks on men. She throws dirt over the casket of a lost friend. She gives melody to her watery eyes as a child, fleeing an unstable household in a car on a gravel road.

We tend to love our songwriting heroes because their words, tone, and temperament amount to something that clarifies our existence; we then go to lengths to clarify theirs. As plain-spoken and specific as her lyrics, Don’t Tell Anybody the Secrets I Told You magnifies the complete character of Lucinda as narrated in her songs: the wandering woman writer staking out agency, making an art of nursing heartbreak while crisscrossing the country in pursuit of herself. In the book, she writes a lot about the type of guys she was usually after—the “poet on a motorcycle,” she calls them—who often fueled her songs. These boyfriends ultimately sound like Lucinda’s equal: the solitary cowgirl poet with X-ray vision and a cold beer, strong enough to be vulnerable, no one’s fool.

“Can you fall in love with someone you haven’t met?” Lucinda writes of her epiphany, as a 12-year-old, with Bob Dylan’s Highway 61 Revisited, which hit her “like a bolt of lightning” and changed her life. Good question.

Raised primarily by her itinerant poet-academic father, she lived in 12 cities and three countries before she was 18. She was rejected by virtually every label she encountered in the 1980s, not catching a break until she was 35, when Rough Trade Records, then best-known as a bastion of punk, released 1988’s pitch-perfect Lucinda Williams. Ten years later, the blue-skied travelog Car Wheels on a Gravel Road cemented her stature as a great American songwriter.

Lucinda has never been scared to stare brutal reality in the eye, and that unflinching approach extends to her memoir. She spends the book’s earliest pages recounting the disturbing sexual abuse that her mother, Lucille, experienced as a child at the hands of family members, and the lifetime of mental illnesses that followed, including electroshock treatment and hospital stays. Her mother’s instability gave way to at-times cruel treatment of Lucinda. She recalls being locked in a closet at age 3 and the ceaseless feeling of walking on eggshells. Her father raised her to believe she couldn’t harbor anger towards her mom, since she was unwell, imbuing Lucinda with a mix of compassion and profound confusion.

Her stated wish to avoid writing “a sugarcoated book like you find at Walgreens” continues with her discussion of her beloved dad, Miller Williams, to whom the book is dedicated. A prize-winning poet who read at Bill Clinton’s inauguration and threw literary parties attended by the likes of Charles Bukowski, he was Lucinda’s hero, collaborator, teacher, and North Star. As a small child Lucinda went with him to visit his mentor, Flannery O’Connor, at her home; while her dad spoke with the literary giant, Lucinda chased peacocks in the yard. When Lucinda was suspended indefinitely from a New Orleans high school for refusing to pledge allegiance to the flag, her father hired an ACLU lawyer to get her back in. When she was kicked out yet again for participating in a civil rights march, he said, “The hell with that,” and she never returned. In the book we also learn the uneasy reality of how Lucinda’s father divorced her mother and then married one of his students, giving Lucinda a stepmom who was nearly young enough to be her sister.

For all this familial chaos, Lucinda writes of both her parents lovingly. Her mom was a pianist who adored Erroll Garner and Judy Garland; after Lucinda moved away, they “would talk on the phone for hours about psychology.” Flawed as her parents were, they afforded her freedom from stifling status-quo social mores. “I grew up in a family where there wasn’t ageism or sexism,” Lucinda writes, reflecting on her resilience. It’s not hard to see her parents as two pillars of her music: the clear-eyed writerly sensibility instilled by her bohemian dad, and, from her mom, an empathy for complicated people, who would inspire many of her best songs.

Through her father, Lucinda’s immersion into poetry was total, and hearing about the workshops, parties, and readings she was privy to from birth—in her living room, in classrooms, and at the summertime Bread Loaf Writers’ Conference in Vermont, where her dad was on staff—helps explain her preternatural facility with language from her earliest songs, written in her mid-20s. She learned the power of crafting images in sequence, which became a hallmark; from her proclamation, “I wish I had a ship to sail the waters/I wish I had about a hundred dollars” on 1980’s “Sharp Cutting Wings (Song to a Poet),” to her description of the maverick singer-songwriter Blaze Foley as a “derelict” in “duct tape shoes” on “Drunken Angel,” her songs play like movies in miniature.

Lucinda’s life played out like one, too, even before fame. A chapter devoted to her months-long teenaged tour of Mexico is a highlight; unable to enroll in high school there, she ended up traveling with her dad’s musician friend, whom she likens to “a young Pete Seeger,” playing folk songs with financial support from the U.S. embassy. Another section details her pivotal relationship with the poet Frank Stanford, also a family friend, who epitomized her romantic ideal—he was a land surveyor and the author of an epic poem called The Battlefield Where the Moon Says I Love You—and whose suicide marked a number of songs on 1992’s Sweet Old World.

Reading about the high school years Lucinda spent wandering the New Orleans streets with her pals, smoking weed and listening to Hendrix and Led Zeppelin and wreaking havoc, or later working at restaurants and health food shops in Austin and Houston while journeying through the cosmic-cowboy club circuit, I felt like an onlooker in a headily adrift Richard Linklater film, where the individual plot points are less significant than the freewheeling ambiance. Bar fights, visits with blues legends, and one arrest for weed possession that threw her in county jail alongside Townes Van Zandt’s bandmates (who would become hers, too)—a lot went down while Lucinda was “stuck between rock and country for 20 years.”

Don’t Tell Anybody is filled with musical revelations, too, as Lucinda weaves a tapestry of influences, from early inspirations like folk musicians Violeta Parra and Elizabeth Cotten, to her ’80s obsession with the Pretenders, to Joan Armatrading’s imprint on “Passionate Kisses.” She also delivers on the doomed affairs and (sometimes hilarious) romantic sharp turns behind plenty of her most cherished lyrics. She fills in the gaps of the tense anticipation (and, sorry to report, immediate disappointment) that led to 1988’s “I Just Wanted to See You So Bad,” and chronicles her experience writing “2 Kool 2 Be 4-Gotten” while “hungover as fuck” one hazy New Year’s Day. We learn about the outlaw boyfriend at the heart of “Lake Charles” and the womanizer who sparked “Metal Firecracker.” (Brace yourself to hear who inspired 2003’s canonical “Those Three Days,” her gut-punching exorcism of a weekend-long fling.)

Most edifying are Lucinda’s recollections of the men in her life, whom she calls “guardian angels.” That includes friends like Hobart Taylor, a Houston journalist from an affluent Black family who managed Lucinda early on and paid her way at crucial times. Taylor spent $25,000 on a demo Lucinda made in 1983, when she was trying to make music into a career. Soon after, Taylor helped set her up with an apartment in Los Angeles, where she hoped to land a major-label contract. She eventually paid Taylor back every penny.

It was in that Silver Lake one-bedroom, with $35,000 from a Columbia development deal, where Lucinda wrote classics like “Changed the Locks” and “Crescent City” that would fill her self-titled album (which Columbia passed on). Her desk faced a window overlooking avocado trees. She would write on her balcony in the morning sun and continue all afternoon in the sunstruck living room, before working out the songs on stage with her band at night. In the L.A. cowpunk underground, she recalls, “dirty garage music mixed with country”; as she describes her distaste for overly polished music, her antagonism towards major-label goons, and her favored plug-in-and-play approach to recording, it’s clear that Lucinda was her own kind of punk.

Her narration of the time spent alone in her Silver Lake sanctuary has an almost holy charge. As her thoughts flow on the page in the unmistakable cadence of her dry, deliberate Louisiana drawl, she talks straight to us. By her mid-30s, Lucinda had finally managed to stop working odd jobs, clawing out the time and space to access and architect her vision. The relief she felt at getting to breathe and dig deeper is palpable. She was crafting lyrics that would form a social vocabulary in the lives of generations of listeners, no doubt many of them women: “I want to know you’re there, but I wanna be alone,” she sings on “Side of the Road,” desiring both love and work. She longs, in this song, to feel the sun and wind on her skin and “follow that unbroken line/To a place where the wild things grow,” evoking the transcendental nature of solitude from a woman’s point of view. Half a century on from Virginia Woolf’s testament that a woman “must have money and a room of her own” in order to create works of genius, Lucinda was living proof.

We have Rough Trade’s Robin Hurley and Geoff Travis to thank for recognizing Lucinda’s brilliance. “I almost fell on the floor,” she writes of the day Hurley called her up at the Silver Lake apartment and offered her a deal on the spot.

But even as she gained a foothold in music, new challenges emerged, like the rampant, misogynist characterizations of her during the Car Wheels era: “difficult” to work with, “insane,” a neurotic perfectionist. “Making records can test the limits and boundaries of everyone involved,” Lucinda writes. “I now understand that is normal.” That she survived so much male ego with her artistry intact is one of the great feats of rock history.

There are moments where I wished she’d gone deeper, like on the writing of her first album of original songs, the feminist string-band ballads of 1980’s Happy Woman Blues. What underpinned the liberated audacity of “One Night Stand” and led her to project its ideas so unapologetically? What became of the titular “Maria,” the restless would-be rodeo queen trapped in New York, who compelled her to ask, “Are the songs we sing worth a broken heart?” And we don’t hear much about 2003’s “Fruits of My Labor,” which has arguably become her signature song. Still, Lucinda’s eye for detail makes the subtext of all her work that much richer; as the specifics of her adventures accrue, the book helps us answer some of these questions ourselves.

Among Happy Woman Blues’ highlights, for me, is “Hard Road,” on which Lucinda addresses her down-and-out buddy Bill by name. Like many of her songs, it’s a treatment for a little movie, with characters who appear in your head: the busker Bill, at loose ends, singing on the corner; Lucinda, observing in the sweltering Texas heat. “They think you’re one of the nameless,” she sings, “’Cause you’ve got no record, and you ain’t famous.” So she invites Bill into the bar to unload. “If you need a friend, give me call, I got your picture on my wall,” the tune goes on. Don’t Tell Anybody makes it apparent that the titular Bill is likely Bill Priests, a confidante and fellow musician who she often shared bills with in the ’70s, as a hungry troubadour herself with neither fame nor a record.

I’ve always found this sweet, simple-enough deep cut to be overwhelmingly moving, though it was only in reading Lucinda’s memoir that I fully understood why. When you’re scraping by, trying to cut it as an artist for years, broke and broken-hearted—a dilemma central to the Lucinda mythology—it’s your friends who sustain you and offer respite, who create a skylight to climb through. For all the hardship in Lucinda’s songs, here is one about trying to comfort a fellow struggling musician, because she knew the other side of it; she, too, played for nickels and dimes. It’s illuminating to read about the people who lifted her up on her path, whether it was her pals in the Texas scene, or even the Neil Young records she put on as a reminder that it was OK to write songs without bridges, when a record exec told her that her songs seemed “unfinished.” To be an independent artist and woman bandleader defying genre conventions in the ’80s and ’90s required finding your people. Don’t Tell Anybody is evidence of how Lucinda found hers.

Toward the end of the book, she reprints a poem her father wrote about her as a child. “The Caterpillar” lucidly describes a 5-year-old Lucinda observing the titular insect looping around the edge of a bowl, waiting to bloom. “I hold the words she said to me across the dark,” Miller Williams wrote. “I think he thought he was going in a straight line.”

Life rarely does. For all of the tortuous turns and wild characters inhabiting Don’t Tell Anybody, it’s Lucinda’s voice—irreverent and eloquent, blunt and soulful—that defines the book. The perseverance of her voice, alive on every page, is its ultimate story.

    "11" : """ Onstage at Webster Hall in New York last fall, Jessie Ware glided through choreography in a faux-fur-trimmed turquoise caftan, and later swung a black whip while singing the title track from her 2020 disco LP, “What’s Your Pleasure?” Backstage, however, was a different vibe.

“I had a bat mitzvah lesson in my dressing room,” the British singer and songwriter, 38, said in an interview last month. “That’s when your worlds are colliding.”

Ware has become an expert at hilariously exposing the gap between the luxuriousness of her music and the realities of life as a touring musician, a mother of three young children, a cookbook author and a successful podcaster (“Table Manners,” co-hosted by her mother, Lennie, is in its 15th season).

“What’s Your Pleasure?,” an album designed for escape, gave her music career a jolt. Her fifth LP — “That! Feels Good!,” out Friday — is a sequel of sorts, but the earlier album’s synth thump is joined by a new dimension: soulful, brassy warmth, often thanks to Kokoroko, an eight-piece band. “I’ve always longed to make soul music,” Ware said. “I’ve done bits and bobs of it, but this felt very focused and authentic.”

Scrolling through a list of cultural influences on her phone in the bar of a New York hotel, Ware debated what to include. “You think Fran Lebowitz would be my friend if I put her in the Top 10?” she asked, before deciding, “She wouldn’t want to be my friend because I’m on my phone too much.” These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

Photo Booths

I’m constantly trying to make my phone take pictures that look old and romantic, and the photo booth just does that. And also the fact that you can’t change it — I like that, and that they’re these four pictures that can take you back to a nostalgic moment. My husband did a photography degree but he’s [expletive] at taking photos of me: terrible angles, manages to always take them when my eyes are half open. What I’ve just started doing is taking selfies of myself, but pretending that I’m being caught off guard so that I can get really good photos with my children.

2
‘The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills’

It’s dirty and naughty and I probably should be doing something else, but I’m there, invested in the Kathy and Kyle drama. And I love it. It centers me. And my husband walks in and he’s like, What are you watching? And I’m like, Don’t judge me, these are really important women that are telling very important stories and they’re very entertaining. I love Mauricio. I live for the moments when he’s stoned. Dorit has really grown on me, I think she’s got real wit. I really miss Lisa Vanderpump. I loved her.

3
Eggs

Because they’re versatile. Because you can have them at any meal. Because I wrote a book called “Omelet.” They solve a lot of problems. I feel at home with an egg anywhere. I said this in my book, but if there was a crisis, my mum would be like, “Do you want an omelet, darling?” So it became like this thing where like my brother was like, I don’t want a [expletive] omelet.

My Saved Places on Google Maps

I hate missing out on good food in a new place. It’s kind of slightly stressful. When we were on holiday for our honeymoon, I wasn’t a bridezilla, I was a honeymoonzilla. But I didn’t have the Google Maps saved lists that could have made my life easier. So when I’m on tour, I save places that people recommend. It’s so good for being able to work out your route for the day, like, I’m going to go to this coffee shop, then I’m going to go to the famous cemetery in Buenos Aires, and then I’m going to walk from there.

Matinees

Jamie Lee Curtis said that whole thing about like, Why doesn’t Coldplay do a matinee? I completely agree with her. Apparently Little Mix have always been doing matinees. Much respect to them. The idea of going onstage at 9 p.m. sometimes fills me with total dread, when I’m usually in my pajamas watching “Real Housewives” or something. Can you call a lunch a matinee? Anything that’s, like, in the day. Then you have time to digest it, understand it, enjoy it. But also time for that eight hours sleep.

6
Handwritten Letters

I don’t do it enough, but I appreciate them so much. And handwritten cards. Emails, I’m over it, I know that that’s how we function. Text messages, I get it. But there’s nothing more thoughtful than a handwritten letter. I think I read that Reese Witherspoon did this, but I write my children a letter every year. They’ve all got their own book, and I write them a letter, mainly so I can remember what they did in the year. Because I know that when they get to like, 21, then they’re going to ask me and I’ll be like, I don’t know what your first word was.

7
Musicals

It’s kind of where I began singing. It’s something that’s really inspired how I make music — that idea of escapism and the idea of melodrama combined with emotion. I like that fantasy aspect of it, that it can kind of elevate. If you say you hate musical theater, I’m going to question our friendship, because I don’t believe that you’ve gone to see good enough musical theater.

8
‘The Traitors’

I’m talking about the first season of the British series. If anybody played the game at university called Mafia, where you have to say who the killer is and they have to kill other people whilst you’re like, staring? The premise is that, and we would all be very rich if whilst we were getting stoned at uni, we thought that could be a great format for television.

9
Foreign Pharmacies

There was a time when you could get Valium in India when I was in my 20s. That was a fantastic time. But also for the products, particularly in the French pharmacies, the beauty products. I mean, you can now get Bioderma everywhere now, but there was a time where everybody would come back from Fashion Week with loads of Bioderma. I love perusing the aisles of a foreign pharmacy and getting any kind of insect repellent, sunglasses, chewing gum.

Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge, or the Knockoff

I got it for my husband for Christmas, but I wear it. It’s obscenely expensive. One day my beautician came ’round to give me a wax, and I said, “You smell really good!” She went, “Oh babe, I got it in Zara.” I was like, You’re kidding me. Zara has done a knockoff, so you don’t need to spend the bloody amount of money that I did. It smelled exactly the same.

    "12" : """ Alec Baldwin was mounted on a chestnut horse in a steep gully in a snow-dusted valley in Montana on Friday, his first day back filming “Rust,” the western whose cinematographer was shot and killed in 2021 when a gun he was practicing with on its set went off.

“Set, ready, and … action,” cried Gerard DiNardi, the movie’s new first assistant director, and Mr. Baldwin urged the horse forward, toward a camera rigged on a pickup truck.

As Mr. Baldwin returned to the set of “Rust,” prosecutors in New Mexico filed court papers formally dismissing, at least for now, the involuntary manslaughter charges he had been facing in the shooting of the film’s original cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins, who was killed outside Santa Fe, where the movie was initially filmed.

The prosecutors, Jason Lewis and Kari Morrissey, wrote in their filing in the case of the State of New Mexico vs. Alexander Rae Baldwin III that they were withdrawing the charges against him “since new facts were revealed that demand further investigation and forensic analysis” that could not be completed before a hearing, set to begin on May 3, at which a judge was to rule on whether the charges against Mr. Baldwin could proceed.

But the prosecutors held out the possibility that new charges against Mr. Baldwin could still be filed, writing that “the investigation is active and on-going.”

The prosecutors dropped the charges after receiving new evidence suggesting that the gun Mr. Baldwin had been practicing with when it fired the bullet that killed Ms. Hutchins had been modified without his knowledge, according to an official close to the investigation who was granted anonymity to discuss the case.

The new evidence cast doubt on the prosecution’s argument that Mr. Baldwin must have pulled the trigger, the official said. Mr. Baldwin, who was told the day of the shooting that the gun he was practicing with did not contain any live ammunition, has denied pulling the trigger, saying the gun fired after he had pulled its hammer back and let it go.

Seth Kenney, the owner of PDQ Arm & Prop, an Albuquerque company that was the primary supplier of guns to the production, said that he had not modified any of the guns he supplied for “Rust” and had no reason to, because all of them already functioned smoothly.

“The guns were not modified,” he said in an interview on Friday. “They were brand-new and in perfect working order.”

Mr. Baldwin, 65, has maintained that he was not responsible for the fatal shooting, which took place on Oct. 21, 2021, on a church set on a ranch outside Santa Fe. He has sued several people associated with the film, including the movie’s original first assistant director and its armorer, accusing them of negligence for giving him a loaded gun on the set that fired. The original first assistant director, Dave Halls, reached a plea deal with prosecutors and was sentenced to six months of probation.

The film’s original armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who loaded the gun that day and was responsible for weapons and ammunition on the set, still faces involuntary manslaughter charges. She had also originally faced a preliminary hearing on the charges in May, but on Friday Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer agreed to delay it until Aug. 9, in part so that prosecutors could subpoena witnesses in their investigation.

Mr. Baldwin still faces several civil suits. Gloria Allred, a lawyer representing Mamie Mitchell, the former script supervisor for “Rust,” and Ms. Hutchins’s parents and sister, said in a statement on Friday that “we remain committed to fighting and winning for our clients and holding him accountable for pointing a loaded gun at Halyna Hutchins, pulling the trigger and killing her.”

“He can run to Montana and pretend that he is just an actor in a wild west movie,” she said in the statement, “but, in real life, he cannot escape from the fact that he had a major role in a tragedy which had real-life consequences for Halyna, her mother, father, sister and co-worker.” Mr. Baldwin has denied the claims in the civil suits against him.

The revived production of “Rust” is going ahead with the support of Ms. Hutchins’s widower, Matthew Hutchins, who was named an executive producer.

After New Mexico’s Occupational Health and Safety Bureau found that the company had demonstrated “plain indifference to the recognized hazards associated with the use of firearms on set,” the company behind the movie, Rust Movie Productions, agreed this year to pay a $100,000 settlement, which included a downgraded citation.

As filmmakers returned to finish the movie more than a year after the killing of Ms. Hutchins had shut down the film, they moved the production here to Montana, to a film set just north of Yellowstone National Park. Joel Souza, who was also struck by the bullet that killed Ms. Hutchins, was back in the director’s chair. He said in a statement that his “every effort on this film will be devoted to honoring Halyna’s legacy and making her proud.”

At the new location, Mr. Baldwin had gotten back into character as Harland Rust, a notorious outlaw who helps his grandson escape the death penalty, fleeing with him on horseback.

As filming resumed, and a light snow fell on the shrub land, the film’s newly hired armorer, Andrew Wert, adjusted the leather bandolier fitted onto the actor. Placed inside was what appeared to be ammunition for a .45 Long Colt. The bullets were rubber.

    "13" : """ The creator and two stars of the new Netflix series “Beef” addressed a brewing controversy on Friday about another actor on the show who said on a podcast in 2014 that he had sexually assaulted a masseuse, comments now recirculating on social media.

David Choe, an actor and artist, has long said that he made up the incident he recounted on his podcast, an assertion that the show’s creator, Lee Sung Jin, and its lead actors, Steven Yeun and Ali Wong, backed up in a statement.

“The story David Choe fabricated nine years ago is undeniably hurtful and extremely disturbing,” said Lee, Yeun and Wong, who are also executive producers on “Beef.” “We do not condone this story in any way, and we understand why this has been so upsetting and triggering.”

They added, “We’re aware David has apologized in the past for making up this horrific story, and we’ve seen him put in the work to get the mental health support he needed over the last decade to better himself and learn from his mistakes.”

Netflix confirmed the authenticity of the statement, which was made exclusively to Vanity Fair, but declined to comment. Choe and representatives for Lee, Yeun and Wong did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

On a 2014 episode of a podcast that Choe co-hosted, he talked about engaging in what he called “rape-y behavior” when he coerced a masseuse into oral sex. He later said that the story was made up.

“I never raped anyone,” he told The New York Times two years ago.

The clip from his podcast has recirculated on social media since the premiere of “Beef” this month. The show stars Yeun and Wong as Angelenos who get into a road-rage conflict that ripples into the rest of their lives, and Choe appears in seven episodes as the cousin of Yeun’s character.

The 10-episode season has received praise from critics and was the service’s second-most-watched English-language show this week, according to Netflix.

Choe hosted a four-episode limited series on FX and Hulu in 2021 and has appeared in other shows sporadically, including in one episode of “The Mandalorian.” “Beef” is his first substantial acting role.

Choe gained broad recognition in 2012, after an initial public offering appeared to make him a multimillionaire.

Several years earlier, the entrepreneur Sean Parker had asked Choe to paint murals in the Palo Alto, Calif., offices of an internet start-up. Parker offered him $60,000 or stock in the nascent company, Choe has said, which is how Choe wound up a very early shareholder in Facebook, which is now called Meta.

    "14" : """ Valda Setterfield, a leading figure in the New York dance world for 60 years and the wife and muse of the renowned choreographer David Gordon, died on April 9 in Manhattan. She was 88.

Alyce Dissette, the producing director of the Pick Up Performance Company, which Mr. Gordon founded in 1971, said Ms. Setterfield died in her sleep in a hospital, which she had entered a week earlier with pneumonia.

In a career that took her from the Russian dancer and teacher Tamara Karsavina in the 1950s to Woody Allen in the 1990s, Ms. Setterfield was often Mr. Gordon’s onstage partner, an association that began before their marriage in 1961 and lasted until their 2018 season at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Her ties with Merce Cunningham, as a dancer in his company, a teacher of his technique and one of his trusted friends, endured for decades.

Ms. Setterfield had a singularly theatrical presence onstage, and often offstage as well, dressing imaginatively in clothes she had assembled from thrift shops. That theatricality was heightened by her impeccable diction and her low, melodious speaking voice. She and Mr. Gordon were once called “the Barrymores of postmodern dance.”

Valda Setterfield was born on Sept. 17, 1934, in Margate, England, in the county of Kent, and grew up in the Kent town of Birchington-on-Sea. She was the only child of Eileen (Walker) Setterfield, a homemaker, and Thomas Valentine Setterfield, who went from venture to venture professionally.

Her passion for dance, which she discovered when she was about 4, took her to London, where she studied with Marie Rambert and Ms. Karsavina. She watched the foremost dancers of the day at Covent Garden and other theaters, forming a particular devotion to Margot Fonteyn.

When Ms. Setterfield was in her early 20s, she met the critic and performer David Vaughan, an Englishman with an eclectic taste in dance forms who had moved to New York in 1950. He became a lifelong friend. “You know,” she later recalled him telling her, “they have very interesting ideas in New York that we don’t have.”

Following his suggestion, Ms. Setterfield tried New York, arriving with a scholarship from the choreographer José Limón. Soon she was studying with Merce Cunningham and James Waring. It was in these circles that she met David Gordon, an intellectually curious young New Yorker who was already performing for Mr. Waring.

Mr. Cunningham was not yet a celebrity. Still, just watching him teach class, Ms. Setterfield told The Guardian in 2019, she thought, “This is why I came to America!” His class, she said, “had an anatomical sense to it — it went into an amazing range of shapes and steps, as well as the most thrilling rhythmic combinations.” Mr. Cunningham, she recalled, said to her, “Don’t make everything so pretty,” an observation she found revelatory.

Mr. Waring’s work often seemed small-scale, but it opened many doors in its striking blurring of the distinctions between art and life, its cultivation of a form of theatricality sometimes labeled camp, and its study of nonvirtuoso forms of movement.

In the early 1960s, Ms. Setterfield and Mr. Gordon found themselves well aligned for the dance experimentalism that took off at the Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village. The dancers and choreographers Yvonne Rainer and Trisha Brown were among their most valued colleagues. In due course, Mr. Gordon and Ms. Setterfield moved into a loft in the same Lower Broadway building where Ms. Brown and two other choreographers, Lucinda Childs and Douglas Dunn, lived.

During these years, Ms. Setterfield often played nondance roles for visiting dance companies at the Metropolitan Opera House. Decades later, she would speak in awe of sharing the stage with Ms. Fonteyn in “The Sleeping Beauty” and the Bolshoi’s Galina Ulanova in “Romeo and Juliet.”

Mr. Cunningham engaged Ms. Setterfield briefly in 1961, the year she married Mr. Gordon. On Aug. 5 of that year, she was one of nine highly individual dancers cast in the world premiere of Mr. Cunningham’s “Aeon,” with a score by John Cage and designs by Robert Rauschenberg, neither yet the artistic celebrity he would become.

“Aeon,” which Mr. Cage described as “epic in character,” was 45 minutes long. It began with a series of small explosions, and its sequences could be performed so as to overlap. Mr. Rauschenberg, in those days the Cunningham company’s stage manager as well as its chief designer, devised a machine that crossed the stage on a rope.

At the Judson Church, Ms. Setterfield danced in works by Ms. Rainer, Mr. Gordon and others. Here, pedestrian movement was OK; improvisation was OK; minimalism was OK. And, although Ms. Rainer famously announced “No to theatricality,” it would have been truer to say that the Judson dance makers were continually re-exploring theatricality and redefining the nature of theater.

Ms. Setterfield combined these activities with motherhood. She left the Cunningham troupe when she and Mr. Gordon had a son, Ain, in 1962, but she was brought back in 1965 and stayed until 1975, creating roles in 13 Cunningham works. The sets were designed by, among others, Jasper Johns, Bruce Nauman and Frank Stella; the composers included John Cage, Toshi Ichiyanagi, Pauline Oliveros and David Tudor.

Mr. Gordon established the Pick Up Performance Company to make new dances in 1971. Three years later he created “Chair” for Ms. Setterfield and himself, which introduced a long series of works in which she was his partner, his muse or his protagonist. Those works were often about the connections and paradoxes between art and life.

In 1982, the couple were the subject of a long profile in The New Yorker written by the critic Arlene Croce. It was one of many signs that postmodern dance had graduated into the big leagues.

As the years passed, it pleased Mr. Gordon to find an ever more diverse array of roles for his wife.

In 1988, when he created “Mates” for Britain’s Rambert Dance Company, he gave her a role, thus linking her to the troupe’s founder, Marie Rambert, who had trained her more than 30 years before. Ms. Setterfield was the artist Marcel Duchamp in Mr. Gordon’s “The Mysteries and What’s So Funny” (1991), the Old Man and the Old Woman in his adaptation of Eugene Ionesco’s “The Chairs” (2004), and Bertolt Brecht in his “Uncivil Wars” (2006).

Ms. Setterfield also performed independently of Mr. Gordon, in acting as well as dancing roles. She had featured film roles in Brian De Palma’s “The Wedding Party” (1969) and Yvonne Rainer’s “Lives of Performers” (1972), and minor roles in two movies by Woody Allen, “Mighty Aphrodite” (1995) and “Everyone Says I Love You” (1996).

On television, she was seen in “Beyond the Mainstream” (1980), an episode of the PBS series “Dance in America.” In 1987, she co-starred with Mikhail Baryshnikov in “David Gordon’s Made in USA,” an installment of PBS’s “Great Performances.” And in 1992 she was a member of the White Oak Dance Project, the company founded by Mr. Baryshnikov.

From 1994 to 2013, Ms. Setterfield appeared with Paradigm, a collective led by her former Cunningham colleague Gus Solomons Jr.; in 2008, she performed in a work by a much younger Cunningham alumnus, Jonah Bokaer.

In 2009 and 2010, she performed in France and other countries, including the United States, with the French choreographer Boris Charmatz in a Cunningham-derived production. (“Would Merce be amused?” she wrote in an email at the time. “I like to think so. Into the unknown, integrity ahoy!”)

When Mr. Gordon’s “Live Archiveography” was presented at the Kitchen in Manhattan in 2017, Ms. Setterfield appeared on center stage, as she did in Mr. Gordon’s 2018 revival of his 1972 work “The Matter” at the Museum of Modern Art.

When she was in her 80s, she played the title role in “Lear,” created (after Shakespeare’s play) by the Irish choreographer John Scott, for which she won a Herald Angel Award at the 2016 Edinburgh Festival. Among her other honors were several New York Dance and Performance Awards, also known as the Bessie.

Ms. Setterfield collaborated a number of times with her son, Ain Gordon, notably in the Off Broadway play “The Family Business” (1995), which also included her husband, and for which all three won an Obie Award.

Mr. Gordon died in January 2022, the morning after he and Ms. Setterfield had celebrated their 61st wedding anniversary. She is survived by their son; his husband, the dancer and choreographer Wally Cardona (who performed with her at MoMA in “The Matter” revival); and two granddaughters.

“Rescued” is the first new song Foo Fighters have released since the sudden death of the band’s beloved drummer Taylor Hawkins in March 2022, and its lyrics seem to address that tragedy and the remaining members’ grief. “It happened so fast, and then it was over,” Dave Grohl sings before unleashing one of those signature screams that manages to be throat-lacerating and melodic: “Is this happening now?” Hawkins’s absence is a gaping void in “Rescued,” the first track from a June album, “But Here We Are.” But perhaps because of it, the Foos sound more focused than they have in a while, driven by a fresh sense of pathos and urgency.

Katie Gavin lets a missed connection know exactly what they’re missing on the bold and sassy “One That Got Away,” a new single the pop group Muna debuted last weekend at Coachella. “If you never put it on the line, how am I gonna sign for it?” Gavin sings on the synth-driven track, as the booming, echoing production serves to effectively amplify her feelings. ZOLADZ

“I know that everything is feeling like it’s falling apart all the time,” sings Lindsey Olsen, who records as Salami Rose Joe Louis, in “Dimcola Reprise” from her coming album, “Akousmatikous” (which means “sound where there is no identifiable source” in Greek). Most of the track is a busily looping, pattering, burbling electronic backdrop for her whispery voice, which eventually advises, “It’s gonna be OK/Just make it through the day.” But before it ends, the song pivots completely, turning to slow chromatic chords and suspended vocal harmonies — a brief moment of respite. JON PARELES

Aaron Jerome, the English electronic music producer who calls himself Sbtrkt and performs behind a mask, has been working over “L.F.O.” since 2018, apparently making it stranger with each iteration. It’s an ever-evolving succession of thick, harmonically ambiguous synthesizer chords, coalescing into a rhythm and pushing it aside, accelerating and falling apart and reconverging. The lyrics, delivered in Sampha’s eerie falsetto and George Riley’s confessional breathiness, offer paradoxes and self-questioning: “I’m changing, moving, losing, higher,” Riley sings. The song will be on Sbtrkt’s new album, “The Rat Road,” in May. Whatever the context, it’s likely to be destabilizing. PARELES

The Argentine singer Nathy Peluso enlisted the hitmaking producer Illangelo (the Weeknd, Post Malone) for the furious kiss-off “Tonta” (“Foolish”). A thumping, clattering beat propels her indictment of her ex from seething to sneering to a well-placed scream. She also shows some gleeful scorn as she overdubs her voice into a mocking horn section, trumpeting “tararatata” as she demolishes any hopes of reconciliation. PARELES

Bad Bunny, proudly from Puerto Rico, is determined to expand his music into a pan-Latin coalition. With “Un x100to” (“One Percent”), he joins Grupo Frontera, a Mexican-rooted norteño band from Texas, for a song about using the last 1 percent of his cellphone power to call an ex and confess that he misses her. Grupo Frontera’s section of the song is a traditional-flavored, accordion-backed cumbia. Bad Bunny arrives with a different, rap-informed melody over arena-scale electronic chords. But with Grupo Frontera working, he returns to the clip-clop beat and chorus of the cumbia — another strategic alliance certified. JON PARELES

“I thought that I was hungry for love,” Florence Welch sings at the beginning of a menacing new song, “Mermaids,” adding, “Maybe I was just hungry for blood.” The dark, brooding track sounds of a piece with “Dance Fever,” the group’s 2022 album that often found Welch threading her personal recollections and musings into a more mythical tapestry. That contrast emerges in the second movement of “Mermaids,” when Welch sings memorably about long nights of London debauchery and “hugging girls that smelt like Britney Spears and coconuts.” ZOLADZ

At Coachella and now online, Chris of Christine and the Queens has gone primal and musically skeletal. “I need you to love me,” he sings in “True Love,” over a blipping, tapping two-chord track, joined by 070 Shake, who sees “your dark eyes staring at me.” The song is measured and quantized, but thoroughly obsessional. PARELES

The latest cross-cultural foray by the banjoist Béla Fleck is a collaboration with the bassist Edgar Meyer and two Indian musicians: Zakir Hussain on tabla and Rakesh Chaurasia on bansuri (bamboo flute). For most of “Motion,” Fleck takes a supporting role behind rising, inquisitive melodies from the bass and bansuri as Hussain’s tabla stirs up a fluttering momentum. When banjo and bansuri share a melody in unison, the eerie timbre is an acoustic discovery. PARELES

    "16" : """ “Giving voice to our darkest thoughts is how we gain access to our deepest truths,” the true believer Lisa tells Adult Natalie as a prompt during one of Lottie’s workshops. Indeed, Lottie’s methodology is proven right over the course of the fifth episode of “Yellowjackets,” where destructive secrets are wantonly shared. But there is little healing to come from these confessions, only more destruction.

Take, for instance, Misty.

Teen Misty is feeling especially loose lipped thanks to her friendship with her “bestie” Crystal. Some facts we learn about Misty: The three famous people she would invite to a slumber party are Plato, the “Grind” host Eric Nies and Jack Kevorkian because what he does is “so brave.” She hates deodorant. She once walked in on her parents having sex and wasn’t all that grossed out. And, of course, the one we already know: She destroyed the plane’s emergency transmitter the night after the crash so she could remain the Yellowjackets’ hero in crisis.

That last one doesn’t sit well with Crystal, whose name, it turns out, is actually Kristen. That’s the kind of secret that she shared with Misty, explaining that she never corrected her teammates when they mistakenly called her “Crystal the pistol” on the first day of practice. It’s a detail about her life that she revels in sharing with her best friend, something sort of embarrassing but not actually all that shameful. Misty misreads Crystal’s acceptance. Rather than celebrate their shared oddity when Misty utters the story about the transmitter, Crystal’s expression drops. Misty is the reason they are all stranded. Suddenly the game isn’t fun.

Misty tries to save face, pretending she’s just kidding, but Crystal knows better. “You’re not that good of an actress,” she says. Misty, facing social isolation once more, resorts to a threat, vowing to kill Crystal if she tells anyone. She doesn’t have to. Crystal stumbles backward and plummets to her death. When Misty returns to the cabin, she tells the group Crystal got lost in the raging storm that just descended on the wilderness knowing full well Crystal’s mangled body is at the foot of a cliff.

In the present, Walter Tattersall also knows that Misty isn’t a very good actress. Their dynamic mirrors Misty and Crystal’s, though Misty isn’t as willing a participant in the banter he’s trying to start. She reluctantly plays his game of “two truths and a lie” before getting distracted upon finding the gate to Lottie’s compound. When Natalie emerges, it’s not the reunion for which Misty had hoped: Natalie sends the betrayed and frustrated Misty away.

What Misty fails to recognize is she finally has someone sitting across from her who will accept her strangeness wholeheartedly. Walter has figured out she was likely involved in Adam Martin’s death, but he doesn’t really care. “I like you regardless of your extracurricular activities,” he says.

He’s had his own odd experience with killers — his grandma murdered his grandfather, apparently — and is bizarrely charmed by Misty’s nefariousness. This isn’t the same situation as Shauna’s daughter, Callie, and the creepy cop who is trying to pry clues out of her through bowling dates. Unless I’m mistaking his earnestness for something else, Walter says what he means.

But Misty rejects that. She’s offended that he thinks she’s a murderer and fails to see that she might finally have a weirdo who matches her, a bestie who’s even more sympathetic than Crystal, may she rest in peace. Instead, she leaves Walter behind and marches up to Lottie’s community with a new plan: She’s going to join up.

In that enclave, Natalie has been trying to unearth some secrets of her own. She finally manages to dig around Lottie’s office, and discovers boxes of personal documents about Lottie’s followers. To her it looks like a gold mine, but she’s quickly shut down when it turns out everyone relinquished that information willingly.

With Natalie despondent, Lottie turns the tables on her, encouraging Natalie to divulge what she’s been hiding — specifically, what she told Travis that led to his death. Using a technique from her “time away” — a euphemistic term for when she was institutionalized — Lottie flashes a light in Natalie’s eyes and coaxes out of her the story of the last time she saw Travis.

It’s a seedy tale in which Natalie and Travis went on a bender and Natalie overdosed. In her unconscious state, Natalie saw a vision of the Yellowjackets’ crash site, but none of them had survived. The mysterious figure known as the “antler queen” moves through the vessel among the corpses. When Natalie was revived she told Travis: “I saw it. I felt it. We brought it back. Trav, we brought it back with us.”

As she shares this, Lottie, terrified, looks over her shoulder and sees the shadow of that same person or creature. “Yellowjackets” viewers have theorized that Lottie was the “antler queen” because she dons a crown made of antlers at the “Doomcoming.” But now Lottie is the one haunted by that image. Is it her own shadow self that’s scaring her? Or is the “antler queen” even a single being? Is it instead the manifestation of the “darkness” all of the Yellowjackets carry?

That darkness has arrived at Adult Van’s apartment-slash-video store in the form of Taissa. Tai is aware she is placing a huge burden on Van by asking for her help. Meanwhile, Van has some hidden habits of her own, squirreling away oxycodone when she thinks Tai is asleep. And Tai is asleep when Van takes the drug. It’s the “other one” — Tai’s alter ego — who emerges in the darkness and kisses Van. “This isn’t where we are supposed to be,” she says.

It’s easy to think of the spirits plaguing these women and girls as evil, yet in the final moments of the hour we’re given an example of wilderness mysticism as a force for good. Pregnant Shauna has grown understandably suspicious of Lottie, who whispers to her baby in utero. But when Shauna and Tai are stranded in heavy snowfall they are seemingly guided by Lottie’s mantras about hearing the wind and the trees. They are able to make it back as Shauna goes into labor, her primal scream of pain ending the episode.

In an earlier scene, Lottie had told the fetus, “You are going to change everything.” Now the child is here, a new life entering the world replacing Crystal, who has left it. Bye, bestie. Hello, baby.

More to chew on

Adult Shauna’s Built to Spill T-shirt is a great costuming choice.

An interesting fact for those keeping track of where everyone was post-rescue: Tai and Van were still together when Shauna got married. They swapped out the guest book pen for a dirty novelty pen.

I think the creepiest character on the show might be Matt Saracusa, the adult detective who pretends to date a teen to solve a case. In addition to its general ickiness, I grew tired of that whole plotline this episode including Shauna’s fake tryst with Randy, the most useless character on the show.

The motif of videotape static has been with the show since the beginning thanks to the opening credits, but it’s being deployed more and more in the narrative. What does it mean?

Is Misty actually a murderer? Technically, she isn’t as far as we know, and maybe that’s why she’s so angry at Walter’s assumption. She’s definitely an accessory and you could probably charge her with manslaughter. But straight up murder? Not yet.

Does Crystal become the next meal?

    "17" : """ The first thing we learn about Amanda (Rachael Leigh Cook) in “A Tourist’s Guide to Love” is that she works for a high-end agency called Tourista World Travel. But nobody in this Netflix film even comments on the fact that “turista” is slang for vacation-wrecking diarrhea. That puzzling choice and its utter lack of consequences are the only surprise in Steven Tsuchida’s film, a rom-com that so scrupulously fulfills every cliché of the genre, it might as well have been devised by ChatGPT.

Amanda is dispatched to Vietnam to check out a small tour company that Tourista is considering buying to develop its market in the area. The assignment is also a good distraction: She was recently dumped by her dull accountant boyfriend, John (Ben Feldman). Going undercover as a regular tourist, albeit an extremely well-prepared one, she’s immediately drawn to the floppy-haired guide, Sinh (Scott Ly). He is the kind of dreamboat who has both abs and sensitivity, and can show Amanda not just his country’s beauty, but how to enjoy life.

Sinh eventually doffs his shirt at the beach and emerges from the water in resplendent slow motion, because the clichés here are as tightly packed in as tchotchkes in a traveler’s suitcase: Amanda is a perky American Type A; village elders are cute as buttons and wise as Yoda; street food is tantalizing; jaded Westerners rediscover themselves as they ditch their phones and bask in a rural experience made only sweeter by the knowledge that it’s temporary. The soundtrack’s catchy Vietnamese songs provide the only fizz in this otherwise flat concoction.

    "18" : """ “Ghosted,” a frothy spy-thriller rom-com in the tradition of “Romancing the Stone” and “The Jewel of the Nile,” is one of the least convincing movies I have ever seen. I don’t just mean that the dialogue is trite and phony, or that the characters feel inauthentic, or that the action is badly choreographed, or even that the plot is paper-thin and contrived, although all of this is regrettably true.

I mean that “Ghosted” barely seems like a real movie. It has movie stars, in the figures of Ana de Armas and Chris Evans (and, as the villain, Adrien Brody). It has a competent director, Dexter Fletcher, whose hit “Rocketman” wasn’t half-bad.

But this tedious, unfunny, screamingly unoriginal romantic adventure film is so flimsy and so insubstantial that it’s practically vaporous.

Evans, who can be charming, stars as Cole, a clean-cut, down-to-earth farmer who dreams of publishing a book on the history of agriculture. While working at his family market stall one afternoon, he meets Sadie (de Armas), and within minutes the two embark on a high-speed fling. But it turns out that Sadie is a C.I.A. agent, code name the Taxman, and in a gender-reversed “True Lies” situation, Cole is swiftly embroiled in Sadie’s high-stakes world of international espionage, whisked off in escapades across London and far-flung destinations that look like they were filmed on green screens.

Evans and de Armas are likable actors, but any charm they might have mustered for each other is torpedoed by the facile writing, featuring such memorable zingers as “I have dated some crazies in my day, but you are certifiable!”

The spy stuff is also laughable. The movie seems more concerned with shoehorning in transparently fan-baiting cameos (including Sebastian Stan and Ryan Reynolds) than with developing anything remotely like credible stakes, while the action set pieces suffer from unimaginative staging and some of the cheapest-looking visual effects in recent memory.

    "19" : """ Jessica Burstein, a photographer who in extended assignments captured three quintessentially New York institutions — the “Law & Order” television franchise, the new Yankee Stadium as it was being built and the restaurant and celebrity hangout Elaine’s — died on April 11 at her home in Manhattan. She was 76.

The cause was lung cancer, her sister Patricia Burstein said.

In 1992, Ms. Burstein became the official photographer at Elaine’s, the night spot on the Upper East Side of Manhattan where writers, athletes, actors, politicians and filmmakers gathered in a salon overseen by the imperious owner, Elaine Kaufman.

Ms. Burstein came as she pleased, with her only tangible reward the display of her framed pictures on a restaurant wall (Ms. Kaufman did not pay her). Over the next 19 years, until it closed, she photographed scenes from the haunt: Ms. Kaufman counting cash; Joan Rivers resting her head on Ms. Kaufman’s shoulder; a tired-looking Andy Rooney, the CBS commentator, with a drink in hand; a party to celebrate the 100th episode of “Law & Order”; and Christo, the epic-scale fabric artist, in a romantic moment with his wife and collaborator, Jeanne-Claude. She also crafted striking tableside portraits of luminaries like Liza Minnelli and William Styron.

In 2002, Ms. Burstein shot a wild bit of revelry featuring Candace Bushnell, the author of the book “Sex and the City” (1996), which inspired the long-running HBO series of the same title. Ms. Bushnell had her right leg extended and her left leg bent, while one man kissed her ankle and another man held her. In the background, the writer Gay Talese, a longtime Elaine’s patron, was in deep conversation with a woman.

“Candace was a few sheets to the wind,” Ms. Burstein told the journalism blogger Jim Fitzpatrick in 2010. “She would admit that.” Ms. Bushnell had made eye contact with Ms. Burstein, apparently hoping that she would photograph the scene.

In a phone interview, Mr. Talese described the relationship between Ms. Burstein and Ms. Kaufman.

“I think what was significant about Jessica, in addition to her good photography, she was one of the few women that Elaine welcomed and liked,” he said. “She was very engaging, and she wasn’t threatening.”

Ms. Burstein met Dick Wolf, the creator of the “Law & Order” franchise, at Elaine’s in 1993. He soon hired her to photograph the crime scenes that were conceived weekly for the original “Law & Order” series.

She became the show’s photographer in 1994 and stayed until 2010, when it was canceled. (It was revived last year.) She was also the photographer for the spinoffs “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,” until 2007, and “Law & Order: Criminal Intent,” through 2011.

In an email, Mr. Wolf praised Ms. Burstein for “her ability to capture real human emotion in the artificiality of a film set.”

Ms. Burstein and Mr. Wolf collaborated on a 2003 book, “Law & Order: Crime Scenes,” which led to an exhibition of the same name at the George Eastman House in Rochester, N.Y., in 2005.

Jennifer Curtis, who helped design the exhibition, said in a phone interview that Ms. Burstein’s “crime scene photos were similar to Weegee’s,” referring to the celebrated New York City tabloid photographer of the 1930s and ’40s.

Jessica May Burstein was born on April 7, 1947, in Mineola, N.Y., on Long Island, and grew up in nearby Lawrence. Her mother, Beatrice (Sobel) Burstein, was one of the first women to serve as a justice of the New York State Supreme Court. Her father, Herbert, was an international lawyer.

After surgery when she was 8 to correct a condition that caused her right eye to wander, Jessica received a Brownie camera as a therapeutic device. Not long after, she set up a darkroom and began to use a Nikon.

She graduated from New York University with a bachelor’s degree in 1968, then worked for six years as an assistant to the prominent commercial photographer Bert Stern. In 1974, she was hired as a staff photographer at NBC; she is believed to have been the first woman in that job.

“At that time, the reality is, they needed to hire what they considered to be a minority, someone of color or a woman,” she told the newspaper Our Town in 2015.

Ms. Burstein photographed news events and the set of “Saturday Night Live,” and she documented the making of the 1978 mini-series “King,” about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Bud Rukeyser, a former corporate spokesman for NBC, recalled in an email, “She was a star as an NBC photographer and was clearly on her way to a bigger and better career.”

But she told Newsday in 1978 that she had been fired after being pulled off an assignment to photograph Frank Sinatra for a network interview show because Sinatra’s wife didn’t want attractive women near him. Mr. Rukeyser said at the time that she had been laid off with 300 other employees; in his email, he said that he did not recall the Sinatra story.

She freelanced over the years for newspapers like The New York Times and The Washington Post and magazines like TV Guide, Rolling Stone, People, Time and Vanity Fair.

In 2006, she signed on as the exclusive photographer of the construction of the new Yankee Stadium, which would open in April 2009. “There was no competition for the job; we knew Jessie from some work she had already done for us,” Randy Levine, the Yankees’ president, said in a phone interview. “She was a world-class photographer.”

Her photos were used in a commemorative book for holders of Yankee premium season tickets and were exhibited at the stadium.

Ms. Curtis, who continued to work on projects with Ms. Burstein through an exhibition of her photos at the Venice Biennale last year, compared her Yankee Stadium photography to the project Margaret Bourke-White undertook in 1930 to depict the construction of the Chrysler Building.

“Like Bourke-White,” Ms. Curtis said, “Jessica scaled the structure with the support of the men and women who built the stadium to get ‘the shot.’”

Ms. Burstein donated her photo collection to the New-York Historical Society in 2017.

In addition to her sister Patricia, she is survived by another sister, Karen Burstein, a former New York State senator, and two brothers, Judd and John. Jessica and Patricia Burstein worked together on “The Grandmother Book: A Celebration of Family” (2000).

A longtime customer of Elaine’s, Ms. Burstein began her tenure as the restaurant’s photographer when she confided in Ms. Kaufman that her business was slow and that she was thinking of giving it up for law school.

“‘Are you nuts?’ she yelled at me,” Ms. Burstein wrote in an essay in “Elaine’s: The Rise of One of New York’s Most Legendary Restaurants From Those Who Were There” (2015), by Amy Phillips Penn. “‘Quit? Kid, you’re better than Avedon.’”

Ms. Kaufman added, she recalled, “You got no place to shoot, then come here to do it.”

But, Ms. Burstein noted, “Between the cost of film, processing, paper and printing, shooting at Elaine’s was to be the most expensive job I ever had.”

    "20" : """ New Mexico prosecutors are dropping the involuntary manslaughter charges that were filed against Alec Baldwin for the 2021 shooting death of a cinematographer on the set of the film “Rust,” the government’s latest setback as it pursued a high-profile case that has been closely watched by the movie industry and the country.

It was a dramatic reversal in the case against Mr. Baldwin, just months after the prosecutors who originally handled the case had filed charges against him, including one that carried five years in prison. Since then they downgraded that charge, which stemmed from a law that was not in effect at the time of the shooting; the special prosecutor leading the case stepped down after her appointment was challenged on legal grounds; and the district attorney in charge of the case, Mary Carmack-Altwies, stepped back and appointed two new special prosecutors to lead it.

The decision to drop the charges against Mr. Baldwin came after the new prosecutors reviewed new evidence that showed that the gun he was practicing with had been modified before it was delivered to the set, according to an official close to the investigation who was granted anonymity to discuss the case. That undercut the prosecution’s original argument that the gun could not have fired unless Mr. Baldwin had pulled the trigger, the official said.

It is possible that prosecutors could decide to file new charges against Mr. Baldwin.

“New facts were revealed that demand further investigation and forensic analysis in the case against Alec Baldwin,” Kari Morrissey, one of the new special prosecutors, said in a statement. “Therefore, we cannot proceed under the current time constraints and on the facts and evidence turned over by law enforcement in its existing form. This decision does not absolve Mr. Baldwin of criminal culpability and charges may be refiled.”

The shooting occurred on Oct. 21, 2021, when a gun Mr. Baldwin was practicing with on the set of “Rust” went off, killing the film’s cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins, and wounding its director, Joel Souza.

Mr. Baldwin had been told that day that the gun he was practicing with — a replica of a vintage revolver — was “cold,” meaning there was no live ammunition in it. He has maintained from the beginning that he did not pull the trigger before the gun fired, telling investigators that it went off after he had pulled the hammer back and let it go. But the original prosecutors had said that an F.B.I. analysis of the gun showed that he must have pulled the trigger, which contributed to their decision to bring charges.

In a statement, Mr. Baldwin’s lawyers, Luke Nikas and Alex Spiro, said, “We are pleased with the decision to dismiss the case against Alec Baldwin and we encourage a proper investigation into the facts and circumstances of this tragic accident.”

Paperwork officially dismissing those charges is expected to be filed before a status hearing on the case on Friday afternoon.

Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the film’s armorer, who loaded the gun the day of the shooting and was responsible for weapons on the set of the western, was also charged with involuntary manslaughter in the case. One of her lawyers, Jason Bowles, said that the charges against Ms. Gutierrez-Reed remained.

Filming on the movie is set to resume this week in Montana, where the production has moved from New Mexico. The revived production has Ms. Hutchins’s widower, Matthew Hutchins, as an executive producer.

After the news of the decision on Thursday, Mr. Baldwin posted a photo of himself and his wife on Instagram, writing, “I owe everything I have to this woman.” He added, “(and to you, Luke),” apparently referring to one of his lawyers, Mr. Nikas.

While Mr. Baldwin maintained that he never pulled the trigger, the district attorney, Ms. Carmack-Altwies, a Democrat who was elected in 2020, said when announcing the charges that an F.B.I. analysis of the gun had shown “conclusively” that the trigger had been pulled. But a person with knowledge of the investigation said that Mr. Baldwin’s legal team had recently provided prosecutors with new evidence that the gun had been modified without his knowledge in a way that made it less safe to handle.

The decision to dismiss the charges was the latest in a series of setbacks for the prosecution. After the charges against Mr. Baldwin were downgraded, Andrea Reeb, the special prosecutor originally appointed to handle the case, stepped down after his lawyers argued that her appointment violated a provision in the State Constitution that bars officials from serving in two branches of government, since she is also a state lawmaker.

A judge then ruled that Ms. Carmack-Altwies could not appoint any special prosecutor without recusing herself from the case. So she stepped down from the case last month, appointing Ms. Morrissey and Jason Lewis, New Mexico lawyers, as special prosecutors.

Investigators were not able to determine how live ammunition got onto the “Rust” set. Mr. Baldwin has said that he was following direction as he practiced drawing the gun that day.

“Someone put a live bullet in a gun, a bullet that wasn’t even supposed to be on the property,” Mr. Baldwin said in a television interview on ABC less than two months after the shooting. “Someone is ​responsible for what happened, and I can’t say who that is, but I know it’s not me.”

When her office announced that it was bringing manslaughter charges against Mr. Baldwin in January, Ms. Carmack-Altwies said that he had “an absolute duty to know that what is in the gun that is being placed in his hand is safe” — an assertion that was questioned by some actors, armorers, union leaders and others in the film industry.

SAG-AFTRA, the union representing film, television and radio workers, said in a statement at the time that her “contention that an actor has a duty to ensure the functional and mechanical operation of a firearm on a production set is wrong and uninformed” and added that “an actor’s job is not to be a firearms or weapons expert.”

The movie’s first assistant director, Dave Halls, who had oversight of safety on the “Rust” set, reached a plea deal with Ms. Carmack-Altwies and Ms. Reeb on a charge of negligent use of a deadly weapon. He was sentenced to six months of probation.

A judge in New Mexico will decide next month whether the manslaughter charges against Ms. Gutierrez-Reed should move forward. Her lawyer has said she intends to plead not guilty.

‘Planet Earth III’

When to watch: Saturday at 8 p.m., on BBC America or AMC+.

When “Planet Earth” premiered in the United States in 2007, it was a huge deal — I still remember walking home one night and noticing every TV that glowed through a window seemed to be tuned to the same ocean episode. Since then, sumptuous, epic nature documentaries have proliferated, and televised opportunities to be hypnotized by the majesty of nature abound. Now the third installment is here, as gorgeous and immersive as ever, and reaffirming the franchise’s spot at the top of the genre. Things kick off with “Coasts” — “coasts are on the front line,” David Attenborough says — and segments include seals collectively ganging up on a shark, a turtle resting its head on a rock and drooling in exhaustion and a vulnerable flock of flamingos.

… an hour and I want stand-up.

‘Zainab Johnson: Hijabs Off’

When to watch: Now, on Amazon.

This new stand-up special from the comedian Zainab Johnson covers the difficulties of dating, the role of candy in child abduction, how Harlem has changed and the perils of keeping a journal in a household with 13 children. She has a patient rhythm that belies the tightness of each segment and adds levity to some dark topics. This is also one of the more aesthetically ambitious specials in recent memory; Johnson performs in the round, and the lushness of the visual language creates a sense of a festive grandeur.

… two hours, and I want something happy-sad.

‘Tore’

When to watch: Now, on Netflix.

William Spetz created and stars in this Swedish dramedy (in Swedish, with subtitles, or dubbed) about Tore, a 27-year-old with a failure to launch, though he says he’s perfectly happy living at home and working at his father’s mortuary. But in the first episode, his beloved father dies, and now he has to launch wether he wants to or not. Tore bounces between wild denial (working extra hard, avoiding caring for his father’s dog) and broad attempts to spread his wings (befriending a drag queen, cultivating a crush on a cute florist). If you like distinctive delayed-coming-of-age stories, watch this.

    "22" : """ “Twilight” adapts a 1958 Friedrich Dürrenmatt detective story. It’s the tale of a retired police chief who returns to his work to find a child murderer. In György Fehér’s adaptation — released internationally in 1990, but now showing in the United States for the first time — the unnamed detective’s investigation begins when a young girl is discovered dead near a statue of an eagle holding a sword. This statue is of a Turul, a long-observed symbol of Hungarian national strength. Much like this arresting image, “Twilight” imposes a uniquely Hungarian perspective on what might have otherwise been simple pulp material.

Fehér’s adaptation sets the story squarely in the Hungarian countryside. It is light on specific details like the year of its events or the names and histories of its principal figures. The emphasis on atmosphere over evidence grants the film a fable-like quality. Even the main suspect is known only to the detective (Péter Haumann) as a giant. Fehér builds up his nightmare using visual techniques that are redolent of his countryman and sometime collaborator, the Hungarian filmmaker Béla Tarr, who is best known for his formally and philosophically challenging epics. (Fehér produced Tarr’s “Sátántangó,” and Tarr is credited as a consultant on this film.)

Tarr’s brutalist influence is visible onscreen, present in the film’s stark black-and-white cinematography, its long takes and Fehér’s elaborate, painterly camera setups. The images create the impression of a bleak landscape, a Hungary where the past, present and future appear drained not only of color, but of hope itself. Fehér’s actors offer muted, naturalistic performances, and Fehér limits the number of camera setups and cuts down on extraneous dialogue. His abundant restrictions make simple elements like cuts to close-ups or the detective plot play as cracking indulgences. It’s a style so minimalist, it approaches maximalism — and this combination of pulp and precision creates an arresting and unique work of film noir.

    "23" : """ In Hollywood these days, radical chic is back in fashion. A number of sexy thrillers that dramatize the history of radical politics or pose provocative hypotheticals about the future of activism have emerged. For my money, none match the incendiary power of “Dry Ground Burning,” a feminist gangster movie from Brazil that spits oil in the face of that country’s political establishment.

Directed by Joana Pimenta and Adirley Queirós, “Dry Ground Burning” is a film about insurrection set in the central Brazilian region of Sol Nascente. Chitara (Joana Darc Furtado) is the leader of an all-female crew that steals oil from underground pipelines, and as the kingpin, she strikes deals with gasoline vendors who sell the product at a discounted price. Chitara’s half sister, Léa (Léa Alves da Silva), an androgynous charmer with a mane of black hair, joins the posse after an eight-year stint in prison, and her arrival inspires several nostalgic conversations that temper the action with hangout-movie vibes. The two siblings nonchalantly discuss their playboy father and Léa’s 12-year-old son, conceived with an ex-con who was murdered.

Meanwhile, their compatriot, Andreia (Andreia Vieira), launches a campaign against the pro-cop candidate running for office. Hers is the Prison People Party, which represents those with criminal records, the working class, and Indigenous and Black people — in other words, those who fared the worst under the policies of Jair Bolsonaro’s far-right government, which was in power when the film was in production.

Because most people aren’t familiar with the films of Pimenta and Queirós, I’m compelled to draw a connection between “Dry Ground Burning” and “Mad Max: Fury Road,” two pyromaniacal dystopian westerns in which lawless women are not only their own saviors but everyone else’s, too.

But if “Fury Road” is a perpetual joyride, “Dry Ground” erupts between smoke breaks, switching between moments of rugged quietude and bracing scenes distinguished by invigorating, industrial sound design and the collective exultation of bodies — like the one with a motorcade carrying the rowdy members of an anarchic political party hollering a profanity-laced campaign jingle. Sodium-lit nightscapes filled with steely, gun-toting dames recall the glossy crime dramas of Michael Mann (“Heat”).

Yet “Dry Ground Burning” isn’t divorced from reality. Though Pimenta and Queirós sprinkle science-fiction touches throughout the film, their approach is steeped in renegade documentary methods and influenced by the contributions of real locals. The cast is composed of nonprofessional actors from the region who play semi-fictionalized versions of themselves — Silva, for instance, joined the production when she was released from prison. In order to clear the streets for the motorcade scene, the People Prison Party was officially registered as a political campaign.

Pimenta and Queirós invent a world in which Brazilian women at the very bottom of the social totem pole take matters into their own hands. They do so without an ounce of fear or self-pity — and in killer style to boot. And it’s not just artist types and famous actors who enact these possibilities, but the very people most empowered by imagining themselves otherwise.

    "24" : """ Loren Cameron was in his early 30s when he went to buy his first suit, walking nervously into unfamiliar territory, a haberdashery for short men. Size was a delicate subject for him. He was 5-foot-3 and wanted so much to be bigger, equating masculinity with heft — which is why he was also a dedicated body builder.

The salesman sized him up “as a regular working-class Joe,” as Mr. Cameron put it, and set out to teach him the rituals of fine dressing. He fitted Mr. Cameron into a double-breasted Italian-made suit, taught him the difference between a half and a full Windsor tie knot, and showed him four variations on folding a pocket square.

He even offered dating advice: Never give a woman a rose on a first date. Offer carnations instead.

Mr. Cameron took a self-portrait in that snappy suit, handsome, bearded and brandishing a bunch of carnations, creating one of many tender and lovely photographs of transgender men like himself that he collected in “Body Alchemy: Transsexual Portraits,” published in 1996.

“I felt at least two inches taller when I walked out of there,” Mr. Cameron wrote of his suit-shopping adventure, “and it wasn’t because of the elevator shoes.”

Mr. Cameron, a photographer and activist whose depictions of transgender people — and documentation of his own experience — inspired a generation, died on Nov. 18 at his home in Berkeley, Calif. He was 63.

The cause was suicide, his sister Susan Tarleton said, adding that he had suffered from congestive heart failure. He had been isolated from friends and family for many years, and his death was not widely reported at the time.

When “Body Alchemy” appeared, it was a revelation. At the time, it was groundbreaking, even radical, to photograph transgender people as regular folk, rather than as exotics or freaks or medical specimens, and rarer still for the lensman to be transgender.

Images of transgender women were more familiar than those of transgender men, and they were often famous figures, like Christine Jorgensen, the American actress whose transition surgery in the 1950s was front-page news, and Jan Morris, the British journalist and travel writer who wrote of her own transition in her 1974 memoir, “Conundrum.”

Over the decades, fine artists like Andy Warhol, Robert Mapplethorpe and Diane Arbus “have all trained their lenses on the transgendered figure,” Kate Bornstein, the gender theorist and author, wrote in The Bay Area Reporter in reviewing “Body Alchemy” upon its release. “Never have the transgendered seriously photographed their own. Not until Loren Cameron, that is.”

In “Body Alchemy,” for perhaps the first time, transgender men could see representations of themselves outside of the pages of medical texts.

There was Jeffrey, a Jewish man who had yearned to be a bar mitzvah, affirming his heritage, and was able to do so. Mr. Cameron photographed him in a prayer shawl and yarmulke.

Brynn, a rangy surfer, was shown in the back of his van pulling on his wet suit, short board at the ready. Stephan, a police sergeant who was honored for his valor and who transitioned while on the job, was framed against his squad car.

There were nudes, too, the most potent of which was a photo of Mr. Cameron in a classic bodybuilder pose, back arched, muscles rippling, his body emblazoned with flame-shaped tattoos, injecting his buttock with a syringe of testosterone.

Mr. Cameron wrote eloquently and honestly of the challenges of therapies, like his biweekly testosterone shot, which played havoc with his mood, escalating his temper and often making him emotionally distant from his partner, Kayt, a lesbian.

He framed a pair of portraits of himself with the typical responses his body often provoked, rendered in a bold typeface: “You’re so exotic! May I take your photograph?” “You must be some kind of freak.” “You don’t belong here.”

Despite such bigotry and stigma, Mr. Cameron’s observations reflected “a kind of innocence and awe of the body,” Patricia Holt wrote in her review for The San Francisco Examiner in 1997. She called the book a “poignant yet matter-of-fact study” of transgender people that was both “sensitive and insightful.”

Susan Stryker, the transgender historian, connected Mr. Cameron’s “breakthrough,” as she put it in a phone interview, to the AIDS crisis, when shifting notions of queer identity and community “allowed trans people previously marginalized within feminist and gay activism” to find greater visibility. “Loren was on the ground as that change was happening, and he documented it from the inside,” she said.

Mr. Cameron’s work was exhibited all over the country, in galleries and universities like Cornell, to which he donated his papers in the early 2000s, when he was in his early 40s. Among his papers is his high school yearbook showing a young woman as class president. “I was cute, huh?” Mr. Cameron wrote in the margin before he sent it to Cornell.

“He wasn’t invested in hiding that he had been a woman,” said Brenda Marston, curator of Cornell’s Human Sexuality Collection. “He put his whole body and soul out there.”

Loren Rex Cameron was born on March 13, 1959, in Pasadena, Calif. His mother, Barbara (Chambers) Cameron, was an office manager at Sears. After her death in 1968, he moved to Dover, Ark., to live with his father, Robert, a nuclear engineer and nuclear plant manager.

Robert Cameron had a farm and raised horses, and Loren worked alongside him, building fences and taking care of the horses. He was daring and adventurous as a teenager, as he wrote in “Body Alchemy,” drag racing and rafting swollen rivers. He dressed in overalls and work boots and learned to swear like a trucker.

He was deeply uncomfortable in his female body, and at age 12 he wrote away for information on sex changes. When a friend suggested that he might be a lesbian, he thought, “Why not?” But classmates began to treat him as an outcast, and he quit school and ran away from home, traveling the country by bus. He found work picking fruit and cleaning construction sites.

He ran a truck-stop fuel station and joined a youth conservation-corps crew, where he met a group of lesbians, who told him that he might find a like-minded community in San Francisco.

He lived as a lesbian for nine years before addressing his discomfort with his gender. He was 26 and had recently quit smoking pot and cigarettes. “For the first time in my life, I wasn’t numb,” he wrote.

As he began to transition, he took snapshots of the process, sending them to family and friends so they could get used to his new body and also see how happy he was. “What was initially a crude documentation of my personal journey became an impassioned mission,” he wrote. He took a basic photography class, bought a simple Pentax K1000 and began photographing other transgender people and learning their stories.

“I wanted the world to see us,” he wrote, “I mean, really see us.”

In addition to his sister Ms. Tarleton, Mr. Cameron is survived by two other sisters, Catanya Saltzman and Cameron Oppenheim, and a stepsister, Lynne Kelly.

Mr. Cameron often said his aesthetic was influenced by the photography books his parents had at home, work by Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange that made vivid the stories his father had told of growing up poor during the Depression. His work ethic was inspired by his father, who taught him to mend fences and bale hay — to honor manual labor.

“The last time I saw him, he told me that I had a lot of guts to move to California with only a duffel bag and a hundred bucks in my pocket,” Mr. Cameron wrote. “I think if he could see me now, he would be proud to call me his son.”

    "25" : """ Ten years ago, Dance Theater of Harlem was reborn. Founded in 1969, the company had gone into hiatus in 2004, saddled with debt; in 2013, it returned to the stage — full of hope and promise but shaky. Its first New York program opened with “Agon,” a difficult and exposing ballet by George Balanchine, the company’s artistic godfather, and what the performance exposed was that there was a lot of work to do.

What a difference on Wednesday, when the troupe opened its program at New York City Center with another challenging piece by Balanchine, “Allegro Brillante.” All was radiance, sparkle and joy flowing from sure technique. And all this was a testament to how well Virginia Johnson, the former company star who returned as artistic director, has led the troupe back to health. She’s now stepping down, and she can be assured she has done her job.

The lead dancers in “Allegro Brillante,” Amanda Smith and Kouadio Davis, were wonderful. Davis is solid, dependable. Smith is luxuriant. She basks in the music, milks the steps, and if she struggles a little in the middle of a quick sequence, she knows how to sell the capping pose. But the revived company has long featured a few standouts. More significant was the strength and spirit of the four backing couples: no weak links.

That’s a happy sight, a triumphant achievement, even though another erratic aspect of Johnson’s tenure — the quality of commissioned works — stayed erratic in the program’s two New York premieres.

“Sounds of Hazel” is a worthy and well-meaning project. It is a tribute to Hazel Scott, a virtuosic pianist from Harlem who was a glamorous star (appearing in movies as herself, starring in her own TV show) and also a civil rights role model (both on her own and as the wife of the congressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr.) before her career was destroyed in the Red Scare of the 1950s. We learn about her remarkable, underappreciated life in an effective introductory video and program essay. But the ballet itself is a disappointment.

Oddly, it doesn’t feature much music by Scott. We hear her version of Chopin’s “Minute Waltz,” giving us a taste of the swinging-the-classics style for which she was known, and a later track of straight-ahead Ellingtonian jazz. But mostly we hear an original score by the D.J. and composer Erica Blunt that largely sounds like hotel lounge music from the early 2000s — samples of muted trumpet with beats.

Worse, the choreography, by Tiffany Rea-Fisher, doesn’t illuminate its biographical subject. In the introductory video, Rea-Fisher tells us that the polyrhythms of Trinidad, Scott’s birthplace, allowed her to swing the classics so well, yet the dance fails to bring that idea to life. Paris, where she later lived in exile, is bizarrely represented by a kind of mannequin dance set to a music-box version of “La Vie en Rose.”

We do hear Scott’s voice, giving an amazingly calibrated, Obama-like radio speech about her love of America, despite its flaws. But what’s missing most of all is an equivalent for Scott’s virtuosity. Daphne Lee, as a Scott figure in a sparkly gown, captures her panache from the waist up, winking and miming piano playing, a bit absurdly. But Rea-Fisher doesn’t give Lee any steps that rival Scott’s thrilling runs, lighting left-hand patterns or cross-hand tricks. The showy articulateness of ballet would seem to be the perfect embodiment of Scott’s style, but here it is merely gestured at. The essential flaw of the work is too much telling, not enough showing.

It’s not as though the company’s dancers lack the technique to do Scott justice. They demonstrate it in delicious abundance in the other premiere, William Forsythe’s “Blake Works IV.” As the title indicates, this is part of a series, made for other dancers and companies, set to the moody, electronic soul music of James Blake. For a digital version created at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, it acquired a focus on the ballet barre, playfully exaggerating the side-to-side logic of barre exercises.

This iteration closely resembles previous ones, but it is this company’s first work by Forsythe, and its sexiness suits them. The solo-after-solo structure is here strung out to include 15 dancers, but that formal sameness is forgivable as, one after another, they spin and shine in individualized ways.

These dancers can do Forsythe, and they can do Balanchine. They don’t have to tell you that Dance Theater of Harlem is once again a great ballet company. They show it.

    "26" : """ He turned Will Smith into a cerulean genie for the 2019 live-action “Aladdin” and twice reimagined Sherlock Holmes as a swashbuckling rogue, to hefty box-office returns. As a filmmaker, though, Guy Ritchie has long been synonymous with sprawling ensemble pictures like “Snatch,” “The Gentlemen” and “Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels”: laddish, kinetic crime capers larded with movie stars, bloodied knuckles and inscrutable Cockney accents. (The latest of such outings, an antic international spy lark called “Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre” featuring Jason Statham, Hugh Grant and Aubrey Plaza, arrived to middling fanfare this past March.)

So why is “Guy Ritchie’s The Covenant,” a somber-looking Afghanistan war drama about an American sergeant (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his Afghan interpreter (Dar Salim), the first of the director’s 15 features to formally bear his name? The answer, according to its U.S. distributor, MGM, turns out to be fairly prosaic: Another company had already asserted rights to the title. (“Lee Daniels’ The Butler,” produced by the Weinstein Company, faced a similar challenge in court from Warner Brothers in 2013 and lost, precipitating a hasty last-minute change.)

But this kind of déjà vu is hardly new: Broad-strokes monikers like “Crash,” “Heat" and “Rush” have all done double duty over the last few decades; “Twilight” is the name of both a poorly received 1998 neo-noir starring Paul Newman and Susan Sarandon and the 2008 teen-vampire juggernaut that launched four fanged, lugubrious sequels, as well as a cult 1990 mystery by the Hungarian filmmaker György Fehér. (Ritchie might have called his latest‌ ‌ “The Interpreter” instead, had that appellation not already been claimed by a 2005 Sydney Pollack political thriller starring Nicole Kidman; so back, alas, to the drawing board.)

If the back story of “The Covenant” wanders into the weeds of copyright law, “Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio,” which won the Academy Award for best animated feature last month, makes an easier case for its qualifier: Without it, the movie could hardly be set apart from both the 1940 Disney classic still widely seen as definitive and an uncanny remake led by Tom Hanks — it currently sits at a grim 29 percent approval rating on the critical-aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes — released less than two months before.

In a larger sense, though, the inclusion of del Toro’s name also serves as shorthand and a promise, portending not only the age-old tale of a wooden boy made real but the particular vision of its maker — a lush, prolific fantasist famed for the distinctive visual style and dazzling gothic grotesqueries of films like “Pan’s Labyrinth” (2006) and the best picture-winning “The Shape of Water” (2017). That del Toro actually split directing duties for “his” “Pinocchio” with Mark Gustafson seems almost a footnote. Though Gustafson, an industry journeyman with a wide range of writing and animation credits (“Fantastic Mr. Fox," the original California Raisins), shared both the stage and the statuette with del Toro at this year’s Oscars ceremony, it’s the latter’s renown, by most Hollywood metrics, that matters.

With “Pinocchio” and the 2022 Netflix horror-anthology series “Guillermo del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities,” the director joins a long line of auteurs, from Alfred Hitchcock to Tim Burton, whose presence not merely above the title but in it serves as a stylistic marker, even when it’s not strictly their hand guiding the material. (The horror godhead Wes Craven habitually did the same; see “Wes Craven’s New Nightmare.”) Few, though, can claim to be the one-man industry that is Tyler Perry, who retains full ownership of the projects produced under his personal shingle at his stand-alone studio in Atlanta. The multihyphenate creator has famously put‌‌ his signature on several movie and television titles released under its umbrella — including “Tyler Perry’s A Madea Homecoming,” the most recent iteration of the reliably raucous comedies that he also writes and stars in as a salty, well-cushioned matriarch of a certain age.

While Madea is Perry’s wholesale creation, indubitably linked to the man who wears her wig onscreen, certain intellectual properties with roots that reach back centuries have tilted their brims instead toward a more literal (and literary) acknowledgment of the source. Think of the high-gloss 1990s productions “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” (directed by Francis Ford Coppola) and “Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein” (directed by Kenneth Branagh): It takes both the budget and the personal leverage of a prestige director, one presumes, to lay claim to the definitive versions of characters who have long been turned over to the public domain. Neither movie did much service to these iconic novels, but show business, as always, carries on: Coppola’s four-decades-in-the-making passion project “Megalopolis,” which wrapped shooting several weeks ago, was funded in part, he has publicly said, by his long-ago work on “Bram Stoker’s Dracula.” And Branagh, having recently mined his own Irish childhood for the dewy black-and-white drama “Belfast” (which won him an Oscar for original screenplay), will next direct and star as Hercule Poirot in his third Agatha Christie adaptation in six years, “A Haunting in Venice,” due this September. Neither he nor Christie is officially billed in the title.

    "27" : """ The New York Philharmonic, saying it hoped to use culture to help ease political tensions, announced plans on Thursday for a summer tour in Asia, including stops in Hong Kong and Taiwan and a visit to mainland China by a small group of musicians.

The tour will be the Philharmonic’s first visit to Asia since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, when many countries in the region shut their borders. It comes amid rising tensions between the United States and China and concerns about the possibility of a crisis over Taiwan.

Gary Ginstling, the Philharmonic’s incoming president and chief executive, said the orchestra hoped to show that music could help strengthen ties between the United States and Asian countries.

“At a time when communication and trust are on the decline, our firm belief is that cultural diplomacy is more important than ever,” he said. “Showing that we can span borders and bring people closer through music is at the heart of our mission.”

After a hiatus during the pandemic, American and European ensembles have in recent months explored returning to Asia, a booming market for classical music before the pandemic.

The Philadelphia Orchestra, the first American ensemble to perform in Communist-led China, is planning to send a delegation of 12 musicians to Beijing and Shanghai this fall. (Last year, the orchestra canceled a tour to celebrate the 50th anniversary of its visit to the country in 1973, worried that China’s then-strict coronavirus protocols would create logistical challenges.)

The Cleveland Orchestra is planning an Asia tour in 2025 that could include a visit to China, as well as Japan and South Korea. The Boston Symphony Orchestra visited Japan last year, the ensemble’s first overseas tour in four years.

The New York Philharmonic’s Asia tour will include performances in late June and early July at the Hong Kong Cultural Center as well as performing arts centers in Taipei and Kaohsiung, a city in southern Taiwan. The orchestra will perform Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony, Dvorak’s Ninth Symphony, Tchaikovsky’s Sixth Symphony and Brahms’s Violin Concerto, featuring the violinist Hilary Hahn.

Hong Kong is familiar terrain for the Philharmonic’s music director, Jaap van Zweden, who also leads the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra.

“I look forward to sharing the work of my New York musical family with audiences in both Taiwan and Hong Kong,” van Zweden said in a statement.

The pandemic forced the Philharmonic to cancel three previously scheduled trips to China, where it has had a partnership with the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra since 2014. Following the visit to Hong Kong in July, a delegation of nine Philharmonic players will go to Shanghai for six days, where they will lead chamber music concerts and teach classes.

The Philharmonic is also working to strengthen ties with Taiwanese cultural groups; on Friday, it will present a concert at David Geffen Hall by the Taiwan Philharmonic.

Ginstling said the orchestra was considering a full tour in mainland China in the summer of 2024.

“It’s too early to commit to that,” he said. “But we’ve certainly made it clear to our friends in Shanghai that when the circumstances warrant and enable it, we will resume our visits with the full orchestra.”

    "28" : """ Helen Barolini, a novelist, essayist and poet who explored the challenges of assimilation, as well as the hard-won victories of feminist emancipation experienced by Italian American women, died on March 29 at her home in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. She was 97.

Her death was confirmed by her daughter Teodolinda Barolini.

A native of Syracuse, N.Y., whose grandparents immigrated from southern Italy in the late 19th century, Ms. Barolini brought their journey, and those of many others, to life in “Umbertina,” her celebrated 1979 historical novel tracing four generations of women in a single Italian American family as they come to terms with their origins and identity in a new land, and with an ever-changing social landscape.

“It is the Madonna of Italian American literature in that it shows the transition from the Italian immigrant to American citizen like no other book of its genre,” Fred Gardaphé, then the director of Italian American studies at SUNY Stony Brook on Long Island and now a professor at the City University of New York, was quoted as saying in an article in The New York Times in 1999, when the book was reissued.

Throughout Ms. Barolini’s career, her work was animated by the belief that Italian American women were underrepresented, not only as subjects in American literature but also as authors, and that as a group they faced what she called a “double erasure, both as Italians and as women,” Teodolinda Barolini said in a phone interview.

Committed throughout her life to promoting Italian poetry and literature, she always sought to broaden the depictions of her people in popular culture beyond “Sopranos”-style stereotypes, while giving voice to those previously unheard.

Such beliefs inspired her influential 1985 compilation of short fiction, memoirs and poems, “The Dream Book: An Anthology of Writings by Italian American Women.”

“I think Italian American literature belongs, interestingly enough, not so much in immigrant literature but in the kind of literature that deals with the outsider,” she said in a 1993 interview published in Melus, a journal devoted to multiethnic literature. “Jews have done this, and Blacks have done this; and they have very pronounced figures — very interesting figures that they have created of the isolated person in an alien society.”

“The Blacks, the Jews, the Irish all have their spokesmen,” she added. “Why not the Italians?”

Helen Frances Mollica was born on Nov. 18, 1925, the eldest of three children of Anthony Mollica, the son of Sicilian immigrants and a self-made man who built a thriving fruit importation and distribution business, and Angela (Cardamone) Mollica, the daughter of immigrants from Calabria.

A gifted student throughout her youth, Ms. Barolini graduated with honors from Syracuse University in 1947, and afterward traveled to Italy to study its culture, history and literature. The next year, she met her future husband, the esteemed Italian novelist and poet Antonio Barolini, in Florence.

The couple married in 1950, had three daughters, and spent a decade bouncing between Italy and the United States, where Ms. Barolini earned a master’s degree in library science from Columbia University. She also worked as a translator of Italian literature, including her husband’s short stories, which were published in English in The New Yorker.

In those early years, “I saw my husband as the more important writer,” she told Melus. “It was after I began to get more in touch with myself that I said, ‘Wait a minute, I want to write. I don’t want to just be the carrier of someone else’s voice.’”

With a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, Ms. Barolini began work on “Umbertina.” The seed of the idea came on a 1965 trip to Calabria, where she discovered a heart-shaped tin sewing kit like those used by rural Italian women in her grandmother’s day.

Taking the time and setting as a starting point, she meticulously researched the historical conditions of each era portrayed in the book, and infused the narrative with a feminist sensibility owing to Betty Friedan, the author of the landmark 1963 book “The Feminine Mystique,” and others. While outwardly a tale of diaspora, “I still think that ‘Umbertina’ is more a feminist statement,” Ms. Barolini later said.

In addition to her daughter Teodolinda, Ms. Barolini is survived by two other daughters, Nicoletta and Susanna Barolini; a brother, Anthony Mollica Jr.; and five grandchildren.

In later books like “Chiaroscuro: Essays on Identity” and “Their Other Side: Six American Women and the Lure of Italy,” Ms. Barolini returned to the subjects and themes that propelled “Umbertina.”

“Theirs was an epic in American life, and it should be written,” she said in the Melus interview, referring to immigrant women like her forebears, “for they who lived it kept no diaries. But we descendants can write and tell, and it’s time now before the last of them die out.”

    "29" : """ There is a feeling of total bodily stimulation in Times Square — the visual excess of signage and language that ‌threatens to overwhelm you, the buzzing artificial light that can shake you upright. For Chryssa, the mononymous, ‌Athens-born artist, th‌at experience, on her first night in New York City in 1955, when she was 21 and still focused on painting, was catalytic. In its pulsating lights and screaming advertisements she saw profound poetry; as she put it to a reporter a decade later: “Times Square I knew had this great wisdom — it was Homeric.”

Those few square blocks propelled her own series of experiments with electric light, neon and industrial materials into dizzyingly beautiful wall reliefs of commercial sign fragments, interrogating consumerist ideology with easily-had materials, ideas that the Pop artists and Minimalists would take another few years to get to, and that put her at the fore of the period’s avant-garde. ‌

By 1961 Chryssa was exhibiting at the Betty Parsons Gallery and had a solo show at the Guggenheim. Two years later, she was part of “Americans 1963” at the Museum of Modern Art alongside Robert Indiana, Claes Oldenburg and Ad Reinhardt. But time has been unkind to her legacy. Like Agnes Martin, with whom Chryssa shared an intimate friendship and whose work too has only recently been reappraised, she slipped from the art world’s consciousness. (It didn’t help that the complexity of conserving 50-year-old wiring makes for a tougher sell than a tidy painting.) There hasn’t been a major Chryssa exhibition ‌in this country since 1982, a breach happily cured by “Chryssa & New York,” a survey organized by the Dia Art Foundation and the Menil Collection‌ that has opened at Dia’s Chelsea gallery.

With 62 works, the show, curated by Megan Holly Witko of Dia and Michelle White from the Menil, does not mean to be exhaustive‌; ‌it nimbly survey‌s Chryssa’s fluidity (in addition to her human-scale, electrified sculptures, there are examples in plaster, bronze, marble and terra-cotta) and argu‌es successfully for her place in art’s firmament.

Chryssa Vardea-Mavromichali was born in Athens in 1933 and grew up amid the Nazi occupation of Greece, where she recalled seeing the cryptic messages scrawled on walls by Greece’s underground resistance, an introduction to the elastic potential of language that colored her work. Her wartime experience led her to become a social worker in the early 1950s, but she soon tired of government obstinacy.

She traveled to Paris, taking art classes at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière and stalking museums, where she first encountered American art, attracted to what she viewed as its lack of history. America was, “I thought at the time, a country of barbarians,” she said in a 1967 interview. “Self-expression was more possible.” Chryssa’s enchantment with the grime of Times Square was somewhat left-handed this way, alive to its beauty but not entirely romantic. She recognized in it the vulgarity of America, and took that as a kind of freedom — “How can you work next to the Parthenon?” she posed to a reporter in 1962.

Chryssa’s practice connect‌ed with Minimalism’s strategies of removing the artist’s hand and using non-art materials. She often worked with glassblowers and welders, scavenging her materials from scrap yards and haunting the plumbing suppliers along Canal Street. But where her peers could be petulant (Dan Flavin despised being called a light artist, demeaning it as technofetishism) or myopic in rejecting the past, Chryssa approached the newness of her art with an openness that made room for classicism.

Chryssa’s first blush with Times Square ignited an abiding fascination with the way language’s delivery can be augmented, and her earliest work with light seeks to exploit its complicity in that process. ‌At Dia, her “Projections,” sculptural arrangements of raised spikes that sprout from their cast aluminum surfaces, as if by photosynthesis, create ‌the suggestion of arrows, letters or the patterns of birds in flight. They riff on the ancient Greek advancements of the sundial, making natural light part of their deal, allowing ‌their surfaces to shift and dance as a viewer moves around them. Chryssa was after something similar with the‌ “Cycladic Books,” serene white-plaster bas-reliefs, cast from the bottoms of cardboard boxes, that flatten the ancient Greek figures to which their title refers into literal tabulae rasae — books whose contents are smoothed into indecipherability.

Both series prod at the limits of language (the “Cycladic Books” are, hauntingly, mute), a concern that finds fuller expression in her series of newspaper prints, canvases densely stamped, often with old printing blocks Chryssa rescued from The New York Times, with the graphic information of a newspaper’s columns, reproduced into ecstatic illegibility. (These were especially pacemaking; Andy Warhol debuted his silk-screens of repeating dollar bills in 1962, the year after Chryssa’s Guggenheim show). The newspaper prints accumulate text to the point of collapse, an acknowledgment of language’s paradox, its capacity to at once reveal and conceal. As she told a reporter in 1966, “I have always felt that when things are spelled out they mean less, and when fragmented they mean more.”

That effect is wittily illustrated in “Times Square Sky” (1962), a writhing wall relief of clamoring aluminum letterforms suffocating one another. Floating at the top, inset in icy electric blue, is the word “air,” as in the argon gas passing through the tube — a canny bit of self-reflexive wordplay that allows the piece to describe itself — and the familiar relief of pushing your way on 42nd Street into an inch of personal space.

lso here is “The Gates to Times Square” (1964-66), the artist’s masterwork, a hulking paean to the city’s street-level energy and the complete expression of her original encounter, which took ‌a decade to metabolize. “The Gates” condenses that thrum into a 10-by-10-foot exploded cube of stainless steel, plexiglass and neon tubing. It absorbs the very stuff of the city‌ — its slick modernist skyscrapers and tangles of scaffolding, the orderliness of its grid system‌ — but also its psychic effects: its vertiginous density, jumble of languages, and the cascading come-ons and entreaties of storefront signage. Newly restored, the sculpture buzzes in a far corner like an altar to some neon god, at once ominous and magnetic.

“The Gates” calls back to its heraldic forebears — the Lion Gate in Mycenae, Greece; Hadrian’s Arch; the Brandenburg Gate; Shinto temple torii — as though you could access another realm by passing through its portal. (‌You could actually do this at its debut at Pace, in 1966, where the spacing of its four bisected monoliths was a bit more generous.) But like the newspaper prints, the torqued signage and neon lettering of “The Gates” is abstracted into uselessness, suggesting an articulation of the limitless possibilities of interpretation, maybe, or how infrequently we succeed in understanding one another.

At Dia, “The Gates” is attended to by smaller neon works that Chryssa considered studies‌ — coils of tubing set inside plexiglass boxes tinted the color of smoke, meant to recreate the particular behavior of Times Square light at night, the way its polluted haze remains suspended in air. One of the best of these, “Study for the Gates #2,” exploits neon’s seductive ‌power and inverts it, courtesy of a timer, cycling for what feels like an eternity (27 seconds) and blinking for a two-second gasp before throwing the whole thing back into darkness. What is revealed is hardly as important as being made to wait for it‌: a pile of wires and rheostats transformed into a sculpture that breathes in an endless night.

Neon is an effective metaphor for America: a shorthand for its technological advancement and its failure to produce progress, forfeited to market consumer products, an idea visualized by Times Square with disorientating efficiency. But while Chryssa was suspicious of mass communication, ‌she wasn’t resigned to its inevitability. By dismantling language, she identified its obscuring methods and offered an alternative, surpassing its chaos with her own, freer grammar. “The Gates” can be viewed as a homage to Times Square but also an exit from it, an understanding that the only way out is to elbow your way through.

    "30" : """ The British writer and actress Daisy May Cooper spent a lot of time on the internet forum Mumsnet when her marriage was breaking down. The site is “like Reddit, but for mothers,” Cooper said in a recent interview at a London cafe while taking a puff from a small blue vape.

She was especially drawn, she said, to one of the site’s most popular threads, “Am I Being Unreasonable?,” a supportive community for women second-guessing themselves in relationships. It became the inspiration — and title — for Cooper’s latest television show, which she created with Selin Hizli. The show, which both star in, is available in the United States on Hulu.

Cooper, 36, rose to fame in Britain in 2017 after creating and starring in the BAFTA-winning BBC mockumentary series “This Country” with her brother, Charlie. She is a regular fixture on British comedy panel shows, known for her candor and colorful language.

But in November 2020, two months after the birth of her second child, she separated from her husband, moved out and began searching for solace online. She recalled feeling frightened and unsure of what her next project might be. “‘My career defined me, and now I don’t know who I am, or what I want, and these two human beings are dependent on me,’” she remembered thinking.

Hizli, a friend of Cooper’s from drama school, was also in the process of splitting up with a long-term partner. The two reconnected during this period and started writing the show that became “Am I Being Unreasonable.” A wild and twisty comedy-thriller, it stars Cooper as Nic, a bored housewife who strikes up an intense friendship with a fellow mother, Jen (Hizli).

“We thought, wouldn’t it be great to write something about a female friend being the partner you always needed, especially when your life’s falling apart?” Cooper said over a cup of tea, a wall behind her adorned with hearts.

In a phone interview, Hizli, 34, said she wanted to see mothers of her age and working-class background represented onscreen. “I had forgotten how important friendship was,” she said, “and how much I needed friends in my life.” In the show, Nic and Jen bond over shots of sambuca and dancing to the Spice Girls.

But Cooper and Hizli wanted to portray the darker side of female friendship, too. Cooper described past intense friendships “that felt like toxic relationships I’d had with boyfriends,” including a best friend who Cooper said was secretly sleeping with her boyfriend at the time. When she found out, it was like “a Keyser Söze mug drop moment,” Cooper said, likening the shocking discovery to the ending of the film “The Usual Suspects.”

“I can only write about what I’m going through, or at least base a character around my own experiences,” she said. Cooper described Kerry Mucklowe, the character she plays in “This Country,” as someone who knows exactly who she is. “Kerry was more of me before fame, and then Nic was more of me after,” she added. Reaching for her vape, Cooper seemed more muted than either of those characters, and described herself as an anxious person these days.

Cooper explored the humor and the hardship of growing up in public housing on the outskirts of a picturesque English village in “This Country” and in her 2021 memoir, “Don’t Laugh, It’ll Only Encourage Her.” In the latter, she described playing board games by candlelight because there was not enough money to switch the electricity on.

She had always acknowledged her faults to make other people laugh, Cooper said, and growing up she aspired to be like TV comedians who gave her parents “moments of complete escapism” from their financial struggles. She then channeled those tendencies into writing and acting.

On their first day as students at London’s prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, or RADA, in 2007, Hizli remembered a teacher telling them “they were going to dismember us and put us back together.” Cooper, Hizli said, would never have allowed herself to be remade: “She was always unapologetically herself, and never felt the need to conform to the expectations of this quite stuffy drama school.”

Miranda Harcourt, Cooper’s acting coach, praised Cooper’s unusual faculty for what she described as both light and dark fire. “There are some brilliant British performers who have got the capacity for lightness and comedy, but don’t show you their tragic side,” Harcourt said in a recent video interview from her home in Wellington, New Zealand.

After the success of “This Country,” Cooper and her brother finally had some of the financial stability they had been chasing. Their lives changed overnight, Cooper said. “Nobody tells you how to deal with it,” she said. “I think he’s as overwhelmed by it as me,” she said of Charlie, becoming tearful. “When we were poor, we were so much closer,” she said. “I think money and schedules and work have ruined that a bit,” she added.

Her collaboration with Hizli was the result of a similarly intimate bond. On both shows, Cooper said the writing was effortless. “They are the ones on the computer typing, and I’m just stomping around vaping,” she said, laughing.

Since RADA, Cooper had dreamed of acting in a film and attending a premiere, and so when the writer and director Armando Iannucci asked her to play Peggotty in his “The Personal History of David Copperfield,” she said she felt she had done what she set out to do. In a phone interview, Iannucci, who also cast her in the HBO comedy series “Avenue 5,” said that Cooper defies convention with everything she does.

“I think I could only do the acting thing for another few years,” Cooper said, adding that she preferred writing and being behind the scenes. Though several British newspapers recently reported rumors that she has been tapped to play M in the next James Bond film, she said that “no talks have happened whatsoever.” Cooper said she would have to make the character funny, though she was not sure if that ‌would work. “I’ve never actually seen a Bond film, so I wouldn’t know,” she said with a filthy cackle.

These days, Cooper is back living in her hometown, Cirencester, a historic town in southwestern England she said few people leave.

There, “people know me for eating crayons in Year 6 as opposed to being on television,” she said, adding that there was nowhere else she would rather be in the entire world.

    "31" : """ Jaune Quick-to-See Smith was sitting on the shore of a lake in Montana when she had an epiphany. An artist and curator, Smith was visiting the Flathead Reservation — the home of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, of which she is a citizen. She’d been born on the reservation in 1940 and later moved to Albuquerque. On this trip, in 1991, as she looked out at the landscape that had helped shape her, she realized that she needed to do a better job of communicating. “I’m making paintings and I know what they’re about but the viewer doesn’t,” she recalled in a recent interview.

Then came the light-bulb moment: Her works were about contemporary Native life, but they were more abstract, less direct in approach. “What if I cut articles out of the newspaper, glue them in, and paint on them, like Rauschenberg did?” she thought.

Smith liked Robert Rauschenberg’s process of incorporating cutouts into his works, building his famous collage aesthetic that placed a medley of objects and images on equal footing. “But if I do it,” Smith told herself, “I can make it so that it really says something.”

She started placing newspaper clippings on her canvases and painting around and over them. As the idea took hold, she made the layouts more purposeful: juxtaposing excerpts from The New York Times and the Flathead Reservation’s Char-Koosta News, as well as other printed snippets, that, when read together, became suggestive and rhythmic, creating what Smith calls her “rap.” She added found images, bits of fabric, and more expressive passages of paint, all of it simmering behind large, simply rendered icons, like a canoe. In 1992, she hung above one such canvas a series of objects featuring racist Native stereotypes, including a baseball cap from the Cleveland Indians. With a twist of dry humor, she titled her piece, which stretched 14 feet long, “Trade (Gifts for Trading Land With White People).”

That monumental, still stunning artwork sits at the heart of “Jaune Quick-to-See Smith: Memory Map,” opening this week at the Whitney Museum of American Art. The exhibition includes some 130 pieces from over five decades, making it the artist’s largest survey. Smith’s is the first retrospective of a Native artist that the New York institution has itself organized, a fact that’s less surprising than it is vexing.

“It forces the question of, why not before? Why not more attention to contemporary Indigenous art?” said Laura Phipps, the Whitney’s assistant curator who organized the exhibition with Caitlin Chaisson, a curatorial project assistant. “We’re constantly questioning what ‘American’ means, but in a lot of those conversations, the idea of Native America has not been a part of that.”

Smith’s retrospective arrives as the map of the art world seems to be shifting: Contemporary Native artists have been more visible and sought after than ever before, in museum commissions and collections and in galleries. Smith, 83, also has a commission in Counterpublic, a new triennial in St. Louis, and is curating an exhibition featuring some 50 Native artists at the National Gallery of Art. The show, which will open in September, represents more overdue firsts: the first time an artist has ever curated an exhibition there and the first show of Native art at the NGA in 30 years.

But if the current wave of attention has opened up new possibilities for Indigenous artists, particularly younger ones, credit is due less to the institutions than to Smith and others of her generation for the tireless work they did to “break the buckskin ceiling,” in her words. The Whitney retrospective makes that clear. Although Smith’s curating and activism are represented only minimally, her paintings, prints and sculptures demonstrate how she took various modern and postmodern artistic languages, including collage, appropriation and Pop Art, and made them her own — or, as she would say, made them Native.

Take, for example, “Trade (Gifts for Trading Land With White People),” which, according to the Choctaw-Cherokee artist Jeffrey Gibson, “offers so much allowance and freedom for Native artists.” Gibson spoke of the challenges he has felt in trying to be a Native artist, activist, educator and parent simultaneously. “You need a unified model of how someone can be the same person in all those spaces,” he said. “Jaune has provided that for me.”

Smith has always occupied multiple roles. She and her sister were raised by their father, Arthur, after their mother, who gave birth to Smith as a teenager, left. Arthur was a horse trader, and while attending school, Smith worked with him — and in canneries and on farms — throughout her childhood. One of her favorite escapes was to hide in a tree and read books.

Smith didn’t get an advanced art degree until she was 40. In high school, a white adviser told her, “Indians don’t go to college,” so she did college prep. When an art teacher told her she drew better than the men, but that “women cannot be artists,” she got an art education degree. Along the way, she met her partner, Andy Ambrose, had children, and worked a variety of jobs to help support them. (Her son Neal Ambrose-Smith is also an artist; two of their collaborations are on view at the Whitney.)

In 1976, Smith moved to Albuquerque and started auditing art classes at the University of New Mexico, — it took three applications until the school admitted her. There, she and the Indigenous artists Larry Emerson, Conrad House, Felice Lucero, Emmi Whitehorse and Paul Willeto formed a collective called Grey Canyon. “She’s like a mother hen,” said Whitehorse, who is Navajo and was then an undergraduate at UNM. “She took it on herself to teach me the ropes.”

Grey Canyon provided emotional support, but Smith wanted their art to be taken seriously. She sought places for them to exhibit and in 1979 landed their first show, at New York’s American Indian Community House. At the time, she was making pastels that referred to places that were meaningful to her. They look like enigmatic maps, with floating pictographs and tracks — Smith’s response to professors who emphasized abstraction. But when Grey Canyon exhibited at the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian in 1980, the members found that their modern paintings and abstract art clashed with some people’s stereotypical expectations of Native artists. Whitehorse recalled that white board members “hated it. They said, ‘What the heck are you doing? You should be at home, learning the craft your grandmothers are doing, making pottery and rugs.’”

Smith’s approach to organizing the Grey Canyon shows — cold-calling anywhere she could think of — established how she would go about much of her activism and curating for the next two decades: in a mode between seat-of-the-pants and “when the spirit moves me,” as her father would say.

Her improvisational urgency has had remarkable results. Her projects include helping to save Albuquerque’s Petroglyph National Monument and Santa Fe’s Institute of American Indian Arts. She’s also organized over 30 exhibitions, including important group shows of contemporary Native American photographers and women artists, and two exhibitions that rebutted the 1992 quincentennial celebrations of Columbus’s arrival in the Americas.

Such work reflects her communal mind-set — how she has expanded the space for Indigenous people in art by inviting others to give talks, connecting them to resources, or just writing notes of encouragement. “When I come through the door, I bring a community with me,” Smith said. “I want there to be others after me.” She attributes this to her heritage. “I’m still doing my dad’s horse trading,” she told me, only now what’s being exchanged are ideas and support.

Molly Donovan, the National Gallery’s curator of contemporary art, likened working with her to being “this lucky student in a pro seminar being taught by the pre-eminent voice on the subject. Jaune has a generous pedagogy; she freely shares her knowledge.”

Smith’s early solo gallery shows were in Santa Fe, then New York. She’s continued to exhibit regularly throughout her career, but has nonetheless felt relegated to the periphery: seen and heard but not always fully understood, her work written about but rarely in real depth.

“We’re marginalized,” she said, “and actually, there’s a certain comfort level in that. You don’t have to worry about bad PR, because nobody writes about it — nobody looks at it. So you can do whatever you want.”

In Smith’s case, that has meant honing her collage technique; introducing more icons, like the U.S. map and bison; and adjusting her colors and insistent strokes and drips of paint to better convey the clamorous contradictions of American Indian life. One potent painting, “Sovereign Nations” (2002), features three layered wingtip dresses decorated with American-flag stars (a nod to Jasper Johns’s “Three Flags” from 1958, hanging upstairs at the Whitney). They’re set against the text of the 1855 Treaty of Hellgate, which created the Flathead Reservation.

Part of what makes Smith’s practice fascinating is the tension it carries between her embrace of more Eurocentric, modernist methods and her pro-Indigenous, environmentalist, anticapitalist messages. Those messages feel very contemporary and of a piece with art by Nicholas Galanin, Maria Hupfield, and New Red Order, yet these younger Indigenous artists’ work is more formally experimental and often more direct.

“I’m caught between two generations,” Smith told me: that of her father, whose childhood experiences of being beaten at an American Indian boarding school made him feel like he “couldn’t say anything,” and that of younger Native artists, who “can say things that maybe we felt like we couldn’t,” Smith reflected, “I don’t think I have that freedom.”

It’s difficult to walk through her retrospective and reconcile that sentiment with what’s on view. Her canoe piled with skulls and flag with Mickey Mouse ears suggest that despite limitations or fear, she has found ways to say what she needs to. In a recent painting, she took the U.S. map and flipped it sideways. The move dispels the map’s authority, making it look precarious and absurd. In the center, amid yellows, reds and oranges, Smith added a cutout phrase that could serve as a secondhand manifesto: “NDN humor Causes people To survive.”

    "32" : """ There is a moment that has happened millions of times for eons, and yet has rarely been captured on film: a 12-year-old girl wondering what to do when she gets her period.

Judy Blume described it in print, in her seminal 1970 novel, “Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret.” More than a half-century later, the movie adaptation, due April 28, is putting that awkward puzzling-through onscreen, as young Margaret practices inserting a pad in her underwear. It’s a scene that is so quietly revolutionary, it made the movie’s editor cry when she first saw the footage.

There was just this sense, said the movie’s writer-director, Kelly Fremon Craig: “Oh my gosh, we have never been allowed to show this.”

Filming it “felt like some sort of release of the shame and embarrassment around it.”

Menstruation, burgeoning sexuality and fraught gender dynamics, religion, the barefoot-in-the-sprinkler joys and gossip-twisted tribulations of girlhood: “Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret” tracks it all, and has been both banned and beloved for it.

In the popular imagination, the book is mostly concerned with the changing body and the rites of puberty, and that’s what made it controversial. But Margaret’s exploration of religion — her Jewish father and Christian mother encourage her to decide for herself — also drew the ire of the religious right. The God Margaret confides in is nondenominational; as a preteen, she has agency and choice.

This 53-year-old story is landing in theaters squarely in the middle of today’s culture wars. The weightier issues it reflects, which had seemingly receded, are back at the forefront: overt antisemitism, the widespread curtailing of women’s reproductive rights, and a resurgence of book banning and censorship. “It’s worse than the ’80s,” when the author’s work was first targeted, “because of the way it’s coming from government,” Judy Blume said.

An era in which girls and women were held in an information vacuum — about their own bodies! — seems dangerously close to being resurrected. Even as children are starting puberty earlier, legislation currently advancing in the Republican-controlled House in Florida would effectively ban girls from even discussing their periods, according to the bill’s sponsor, until middle school. (The bill also limits sex education in general.)

“I’m worried,” Blume said, “that if we’re just complacent and laugh about it — like, that’s ridiculous, you can’t stop young girls from standing around in elementary school talking about periods. And it is laughable, and it would be great if it was just a joke. But it’s not.”

Blume, 85, has been active with the National Coalition Against Censorship for decades. Recently she felt ready to step back. “Now I feel I’m going to speak out every chance I get,” she told me.

WE WERE TALKING seaside in Key West, where Blume and her husband, George Cooper, run an independent nonprofit bookstore housed with a gallery space; Cooper, a retired law professor, also founded an indie movie theater. As a couple, they are a major cultural hub.

The theater held a benefit screening of “Margaret” that drew far-flung Blume fans like the radio personality Charlamagne tha God; lots of colorfully dressed locals; and a front row full of tween girls eager to meet Rachel McAdams, who plays Margaret’s mother. By the end of the night, they were clustering around Blume, said her friend Meg Cabot, the best-selling author of “The Princess Diaries.”

The movie, which stars Abby Ryder Fortson (“Transparent,” “Ant-Man”) as Margaret and Kathy Bates as her doting Manhattan glamma, is sweetly faithful to its source, down to the station wagons, wood-paneled basement mixers and coy names for feminine products.

Though the filmmakers may hope for multigenerational crowds, the film is not exactly for children. It’s for their parents, the Gen Xers and older millennials who grew up with Margaret — “the nostalgia audience,” Blume said.

Partly for their sake, Margaret’s mother got a new, expanded story line. “Of any project I’ve ever done, when I mention this one to people, they just light up,” McAdams told me in Key West. “They are so ready and excited to share their Judy Blume stories and connections, and how ‘Margaret’ just changed them, and how grateful they are for it.”

“Judy Blume books, you remember where you were when you read them and the feelings you had,” she added. “They’re just something that sticks with you.”

Treating taboo topics matter-of-factly, with emotional candor, is, of course, what has animated both Blume’s public profile and her writing for children and young adults — a whole generation-spanning oeuvre, with more than 90 million books sold worldwide and a phalanx of devoted (and high-profile) fans who tend to get weepy when they meet her.

Hollywood courted her regularly, but she was protective of her material, and it took a lesser known filmmaker, Fremon Craig, and her Oscar- and Emmy-winning mentor, James L. Brooks (“Broadcast News,” “The Simpsons”) to unlock the book.

It was Fremon Craig’s dream project, and she still got the jitters when it came time to write. “I felt like I was in the room with a bazillion Judy Blume fans, Judy Blume, my 12-year-old self — every single one of them just being like, ‘Don’t screw it up,’” she said. She banished the ghosts and took particular care with Margaret’s spiritual quest.

It was the most delicate part of the story, Fremon Craig said: reaching, at a young, tumultuous age, “for something greater, beyond yourself, in an effort to figure out if somebody is making sure you’re OK.”

“I actually think I was that age when I started to ask those larger existential questions,” she said. “And I feel like I still ask those questions every day.”

This is only her second feature, after the sharp coming-of-age comedy “The Edge of Seventeen,” which Blume loved enough to trust her with “Margaret.” Actually, the author has given the film more than her blessing; some of it, she told me, is even better than her original. In one climactic scene in the movie, all of Margaret’s grandparents meet to lay claim to her religious convictions. “I remember that I was afraid to do that in the book,” Blume said. “I didn’t know how to write a scene like that, with so many people talking over each other. And so I separated them.”

THE CULTURAL IMPACT of “Margaret” is hard to overstate, for inspiring individual readers and future writers and artists, and for detonating traditional ideas about what stories, and narrators, had value. A 

12-year-old musing about faith and aggressively wishing for bigger boobs changed the canon. “It is actually a really brave book,” said Corinne Demas, an author and professor emerita at Mount Holyoke College who taught Blume’s work. “She really said, ‘This stuff matters, and these people matter’ — and I think a lot of young girls hadn’t heard that message before, that they mattered.”

As Cabot put it: “Judy Blume is the Y.A. Philip Roth.”

They met more than 20 years ago, when Cabot first started writing young-adult fiction. “I just randomly got an email from Judy asking me over for lunch,” Cabot recalled. She had assembled a salon of Y.A. writers, all women, at her New York apartment; they bonded over their shared mission to empower girls in their writing.

Cabot eventually moved to Key West, too, and she marveled at Blume’s energy: greeting throngs of fans fresh off a cruise ship at her bookstore, where she works three or four days a week; riding her bike around town; tap-dancing; eating out enough that she has a pie named after her at a local pizzeria. In “Judy Blume Forever,” a documentary out this month, she says that after spending so many years cloistered behind a desk, she wants to be out in the world.

Bates hadn’t read her work before signing on to play Sylvia, the urbane grandmother, the kind who takes Margaret to Broadway shows and fancy lunches. (“The grandma I wanted,” Blume said.)

“I didn’t expect her to be so charming, and tiny, but very fashionable and madcap — she’s just delightful,” Bates said. “I wanted Sylvia to thrill her.” They talked about how to draw out the character; in the book, the adults are mostly ciphers seen through Margaret’s eyes. Fremon Craig gave them more back story, some of it freshly written by Blume, and some — especially for McAdams’s character, a painter who ultimately chafes at being a suburban housewife — from her own experience as a working mother.

“It was really, I think, key to making the movie, just making the mother a character and giving the mother her own journey,” Brooks, the film’s producer, said.

Blume, who has a producer credit, was on set for weeks at a time, including the day they filmed the scene with Margaret and her friends chanting the infamous refrain: “We must, we must, we must increase our bust!”

As choreographed by Fremon Craig, the girls were doing the accompanying moves wrong, Blume recalled — more of a prayer-hands squeeze inward. She whispered the note to a producer and then leaped up to show them how it’s done (a stretch outward, elbows down, chest, of course, projecting).

“MARGARET” IS BASED on some of her own experiences, including rehearsing what she’d need to do when her period arrived. “I practiced for a long time, because I was late,” Blume said. “I even pricked my finger to get some blood and put it on the pad, just to see what it would be like.”

Ryder Fortson filmed it when she was 13, so she was going through some of the same things as her character. Casting an adolescent meant “I was in a race against puberty,” Fremon Craig noted. (Puberty won. There was some CGI, and a scene in which Margaret tries on a bra actually features a boy standing in.)

It was “a vulnerable position to be in,” Ryder Fortson, now 15, said. But acting her way through the awkwardness while also experiencing it “made me accept it a little bit more,” she said. The daughter of two actors and the sibling of another, she moved with her entire family from Los Angeles to the shoot in North Carolina.

“Abby is an old soul, and she’s highly intelligent,” McAdams said. “I mean, she was reading ‘War and Peace’ on set.”

For the adult actors, revisiting adolescence alongside Margaret brought them back to the unease and confusion of that time. “I remember walking across in front of the Episcopal Church” and having someone explain penetrative sex, Bates, who is 74, said. “I just could not picture it; I couldn’t understand the physics involved.”

“I wish I had had better instruction, and better self-esteem that comes with that,” she said.

Every conversation I had with the women included a commiseration on the inadequacies of the feminine products aisle and on how much fear and humiliation there is around female sexuality. “My mother had me at 40,” Bates said. “She was embarrassed because it meant she was having sex at that age.”

“This film resonated on a very, very deep level with me,” she added, “on much larger issues, having to do with censoring oneself and not following the norm. The bottom line is, it’s extraordinary that this little girl is wise enough to think for herself.”

The movie is arriving during a teen mental health crisis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have sounded the alarm for girls, in particular, for whom social media and other factors have contributed to unparalleled turmoil. And yet, women and girls may still be better off than they were when “Margaret” was published and they were shrouded in darkness and shame about their own development.

“It did make me feel really grateful that I’m not growing up in the ’70s,” Ryder Fortson said. “The less communication there is, the less support that you have, the more terrible and confusing this time is.” The film, she added, “might be a great way to really show that talking about this is not bad. It’s actually a really, really good thing.”

Blume promised: “Oh, no, we’re not going back. No, no, no, no.”

    "33" : """ Book bans are rising at a rapid pace in school districts around the United States, driven by new laws and regulations that limit what kinds of books children can access, according to a new report from PEN America, a free speech organization.

From July to December 2022, PEN found 1,477 cases of books being removed, up from 1,149 during the previous six months. Since the organization began tracking bans in July 2021, it has counted more than 4,000 instances of book removals using news reports, public records requests and publicly available data.

The numbers don’t reflect the full scope of the efforts, since new mandates in some states requiring schools to vet all their reading material for potentially offensive content have led to mass removals of books, which PEN was unable to track, the report says.

The statistic also fails to capture the rapid evolution of book restrictions into what many free speech organizations consider a worrisome new phase: Book bans are increasingly driven by organized efforts led by elected officials or activists groups whose actions can affect a whole district or state.

Of the nearly 1,500 book removals that PEN tracked in the last six months of 2022, the majority — nearly 75 percent — were driven by organized efforts or because of new legislation.

Seven states, including Florida, Tennessee, Oklahoma and Utah, passed laws last year that impose limits on material in libraries, according to analysis done by EveryLibrary, a political action committee for libraries. This year, the group is tracking 113 bills across the country that it says would negatively impact libraries or curtail people’s freedom to read.

“This is much bigger than you can really count,” said Jonathan Friedman, the director of free expression and education at PEN America. “People need to understand that it’s not a single book being removed in a single school district, it’s a set of ideas that are under threat just about everywhere.”

PEN’s analysis follows similar findings by the American Library Association, which recently released a report showing that efforts to ban books nearly doubled in 2022 over the previous year, and reached the highest number of complaints since the association began studying censorship efforts more than 20 years ago. The association found that book challenges are now increasingly being filed against multiple titles at once. In the past, libraries and schools typically received complaints about a single work.

“We’ve had two record-breaking years, and those of us who are fighting book bans really have our work cut out for us,” said Christopher Finan, the executive director of the National Coalition Against Censorship. “At this point, we’re fighting an uphill battle.”

Free speech advocates are troubled by not just the sharp rise in book bans, but also the new ways in which books are being targeted. Until fairly recently, most book removals occurred when a parent raised concerns about a title with a teacher or librarian. Complaints were typically resolved quietly, after a school board or committee evaluated the material and determined whether it was appropriate for students.

That began to change during the pandemic, with the rise of groups like Moms for Liberty and Utah Parents United, which formed to oppose Covid-19 restrictions, began to focus on the content of school curriculums and libraries. Members of these groups started showing up at school board meetings to demand that certain books be removed and circulating online lists of titles they found objectionable.

The rise of these networks meant that specific books — often titles that center on L.G.B.T.Q. themes or that address racial inequality — were being targeted all over the country. The debate around what constitutes appropriate reading material for students also became increasingly politicized and vitriolic. Librarians and teachers have been accused of promoting pedophilia, and some have lost their jobs or quit under pressure after refusing to remove books.

PEN and other free speech groups say that the new laws have had a chilling effect.

In Florida, where the State Legislature passed a law requiring that a certified media specialist evaluate all the books on school classroom and library shelves, some districts advised schools to limit access to all the titles until they could vetted, resulting in empty library shelves in some schools. Similarly, after Tennessee passed the “Age Appropriate Materials Act,” which required schools to catalog all the books in their classrooms and libraries to ensure there was no inappropriate content, some teachers chose to remove or cover up their entire classroom libraries rather than risk violating the law.

This week, Tennessee lawmakers went further and passed a bill that would subject book publishers and distributors to criminal prosecution and hefty fines for providing public schools with material that is deemed to be obscene. In a statement, PEN called on Gov. Bill Lee to reject the bill, arguing that it serves no purpose other than to intimidate publishers into self-censorship.

PEN’s analysis tracked bans in 21 states, affecting 66 school districts, but found that book removals were concentrated in a handful of states. Texas had the highest number, with 438 removals, followed by Florida, with 357, then Missouri, where 315 books were banned, and Utah and South Carolina, which each saw more than 100 titles removed.

Many of the same titles are being targeted around the country. Among the most banned books last year were “Gender Queer” by Maia Kobabe, “Flamer” by Mike Curato, “Tricks” by Ellen Hopkins, a graphic novel edition of “The Handmaid’s Tale” by Margaret Atwood and “Milk and Honey,” a poetry collection by Rupi Kaur.

“I do fear we’re losing sight of just how unusual this is,” Friedman said. “Book bans are becoming normalized in many places.”

    "34" : """ In a new novella, “Death of an Author,” the writer, Aidan Marchine, describes a subpar plate of nachos this way:

“The cheese was congealed and the chips soggy, damp and smeared with a greasy film like some kind of lake scum. Gus forced himself to take a bite, but the flavor was rancid, a sickly sweet imitation of cheese. He washed it down with a swig of beer, but even that tasted ugly, like it had been sitting in the sun for too long.”

The writing is vivid, but there’s nothing particularly unusual about it. Aidan Marchine, however, is an unusual author — at least for now — because Aidan Marchine is a set of computer systems. Kind of.

The journalist and author Stephen Marche wrote “Death of an Author” using three artificial intelligence programs. Or three artificial intelligence programs wrote it with extensive plotting and prompting from Stephen Marche. It depends on how you look at it.

“I am the creator of this work, 100 percent,” Marche said, “but, on the other hand, I didn’t create the words.”

Pushkin Industries, an audio production company, will publish the novella next month as an audiobook and e-book. Even the moniker “Marchine” is an invention of a program, a combination of Marche and machine.

In January, Jacob Weisberg, Pushkin’s chief executive, approached Marche, who has been writing with and about artificial intelligence since 2017. He asked if Marche was interested in using the technology to produce a murder mystery. The result of that collaboration is “Death of Author,” in which an author who uses A.I. extensively winds up dead.

Whodunit? Was it her estranged daughter? Was it the professor of crime and cyberfiction who was an expert on her work? Was it the eccentric billionaire who worked with her on a secretive A.I. project?

To coax the story from his laptop, Marche used three programs, starting with ChatGPT. He ran an outline of the plot through the software, along with numerous prompts and notes. While A.I. was good at many things, especially dialogue, he said, its plots were terrible.

Next, he used Sudowrite, asking the program to make a sentence longer or shorter, to adopt a more conversational tone or to make the writing sound like Ernest Hemingway’s. Then he used Cohere to create what he called the best lines in the book. If he wanted to describe the smell of coffee, he trained the program with examples and then asked it to generate similes until he found one he liked.

“To me, the process was a bit akin to hip-hop,” he said. “If you’re making hip-hop, you don’t necessarily know how to drum, but you definitely need to know how beats work, how hooks work, and you need to be able to put them together in a meaningful way.”

Marche said that these programs could be a tool for writers, and he declared himself optimistic about the growth of algorithmic writing in his field. But the prospect makes many writers and their representatives extremely nervous, worried that machines will put writers out of a job. The Authors Guild has called for “legal and policy interventions that balance development of useful A.I. tools with protection of human authorship.”

Weisberg, the chief executive of Pushkin, said that while new tools very often displaced people, they also created opportunities. Take journalism, for example.

“If routine news stories are drafted or generated by technology,” he said, “you, as a journalist, instead of reporting on every fire, can write interesting news stories about A.I.”

Marche and Pushkin tried to use software to create as much of “Death of an Author” as possible, including blurbs and its cover art. But there was one area in which its creators felt the technology was lacking: narration for the audiobook. So they hired a human, Edoardo Ballerini, who has won several awards in the field.

“But this stuff is moving so fast,” Weisberg said. “If we were doing it now as opposed to six weeks ago, I think we could get A.I. narration that would be up to snuff.”

    "35" : """ Season 3, Episode 10: ‘The Last Generation’

“What began over 35 years ago ends tonight,” Jean-Luc Picard says, standing on his favorite bridge and glaring at his most distasteful enemy. It recalled his “The line must be drawn here!” from “First Contact.”

This was ostensibly a reference to the Federation’s longstanding battle with the Borg, but it also applies to “The Next Generation” franchise. (The show began airing in 1987 and 35 years ago would be 1988.) And if this is the last time we see these characters, that’s OK. Not because this season of “Picard” wasn’t a strong one. Quite the opposite, in fact: It was quite good and recaptured everything that made “Next Generation” what it was.

The characters all used special skills to work together and save humankind. Some of the dialogue was campy. There were plot holes. And there were classic “Star Trek” tropes, like Jean-Luc nonsensically going to the Borg cube, when he was likely the least physically capable of the old crew in fighting off the Borg.

But overall, this season was a worthy send-off for the crew. It wasn’t perfect, but neither were the show or any of the movies. But it was worth doing. The story justified its existence, advancing each of the main characters and filling in some gaps.
And it confirmed one last time that “The Next Generation” was greater than the sum of its parts. That might have been why the first two seasons of “Picard” didn’t work as well. Jean-Luc wasn’t the best character he could be without his old friends. The chemistry wasn’t as fluid, and the story wasn’t as deep.

In the finale, we learn a bit about what the Borg have been up to, though I remain baffled that no one brings up Jurati or the whole Good Borg thing from last season. (Maybe it was for the best.) There was no collective left — only the Borg Queen remained, she claimed, though we know from last season’s events that this isn’t exactly true.

It was Jack who found the Borg Queen, at least in her telling. She speaks in a way that is contrary to what we’ve known about the Borg: She says she was lonely and that the Borg were left to starve. (This kind of undercuts the Borg’s whole message of being the perfect beings.) But now, the Borg want to evolve rather than assimilate, and Jack is the perfect partner to do that. (In order to survive, the Borg Queen, I think, resorted to Borg cannibalism. Yikes! Hope those drones won Employee of the Month or something.)

The Borg and the changelings came to an agreement in which the changelings would be the Borg’s vehicle to carry out some villainous plan to help them procreate. Aside from an ill-fated revenge that they didn’t really need the Borg for, I don’t know what the changelings really got out of this alliance.

Elsewhere, classic Star Trekking happens. Worf and Riker fight off some baddies on the cube. Beverly uses her now finely honed combat skills to fire weapons. (It’s somewhat amusing that Geordi refurbished the Enterprise D for display at the fleet museum and also included a loaded torpedo system. Thank goodness he went above and beyond!) Data shows off his lightning fast piloting skills, assisted by his newly acquired gut instinct.

Beverly is faced with an impossible decision: Blow up her son and save the galaxy, or, uh, don’t. I loved that Geordi is the one who asks her permission, because he now understands a parent’s love for a child. And when it comes time to fire on the beacon, Geordi really, really doesn’t want to do it.

Jean-Luc finds another solution. He assimilates himself so he can get in contact with Jack in the Borg collective. Jean-Luc isn’t human, of course. He is an android — apparently, he can just plug himself in to the network like a flash drive. Jean-Luc tells Jack that he is the missing part of Jean-Luc’s life. (Patrick Stewart plays this perfectly.)

Jean-Luc is finally able to admit to himself how lonely he was outside of Starfleet, and that Starfleet merely covered up that loneliness rather than filling it entirely. Jean-Luc gives his son something he’s craved his whole life: approval and unconditional love. And Jean-Luc also won’t let his son go. He offers to stay in the hole with him so they can climb out together, and Jean-Luc gets to be the father he never knew he wanted to be.

Eventually, Jean-Luc pushes Jack to unassimilate himself and turn against the Queen. And that’s that: The universe is saved again. Our thanks to the crew of the Enterprise for the umpteenth time.

The episode ends in the only appropriate way for the “Next Generation” crew: They sit around and toast one another. Jean-Luc quotes Shakespeare, and then they whoop and play cards just like at the end of “All Good Things…,” the series finale of the original “Next Generation.”

The end wasn’t perfect, but it was proper. And that’s about all you can ask from a season like this. I don’t need any more — I want the Enterprise D crew to Costanza it and leave on a high note. They’ve earned it.

Odds and ends

Somewhat amusingly, Jean-Luc does not express any concern for or otherwise mention Laris throughout this season, another example of the team behind “Picard” trying to erase the first two seasons of the show from existence. But Laris, for her part, actually appeared in the season premiere and, one could argue, help put the events of the reunion in motion.

I keep thinking about that scene early this season with Riker and Jean-Luc at the bar, when Riker has to defend the honor of the Enterprise D. We didn't know it then, but that foreshadowed the whole season.

I would have liked to hear more about what Worf has been up to since the events of “Nemesis.” At the end of “Deep Space Nine,” Worf was named an ambassador to Qo’noS. In “Nemesis,” Worf somehow just becomes a member of the Enterprise crew again with little explanation. In this season, it is implied that Worf helped destroy the Enterprise E — more detail would have been nice.

The “Worf as comic relief” thing, as when he fell asleep on the bridge immediately after he helps to save civilization, also wore thin. But there is a fun callback in the last scene of the episode: Beverly saying Worf should have another glass of prune juice. A warrior’s drink!

Pavel Chekov’s son, Anton, being president of the Federation was a nice touch. Anton is likely a reference to Anton Yelchin, who played Chekov in the rebooted feature films beginning in 2009. He died in 2016 as a result of a car accident.

When Seven and Raffi figure out a way to transport assimilated crew members off the bridge using phaser rifles, it’s quite the deus ex machina. That technology would’ve been helpful all season!

That was a funny moment when the cook is ordered to pilot the Titan. He didn’t even finish flight training, why is Seven making him take the wheel? Have Raffi do it! (Within minutes, the cook executes complicated evasive maneuvers, so that must have been some training.)

At first, I found New Data to be jarring but after a couple episodes, this version grew on me. When he says he hates the Borg, you can see the Lore side of him burst through. It’s a fresh take on Data and Brent Spiner pulls it off.

That was a nice bit of wordless acting from Jonathan Frakes and Marina Sirtis when Riker heads down to the cube for yet another mission with Jean-Luc. The swashbuckling Riker gives the slightest of smiles, as if to say, “You know who you married. You know why I have to do this.” And Troi reluctantly agrees. Later, when Troi tells Riker he will only have a minute or so to save Jean-Luc once the Enterprise fires on the Cube, he responds again with cool confidence in a near death situation.

There will certainly be some disappointment among fans that Kate Mulgrew did not reprise her role as Admiral Janeway this season. The events in “Voyager” presumably are the reason the Borg cube was in such terrible shape when Jean-Luc beams aboard. Given the multiple references to Janeway and what was happening on Earth, it would have been nice to have gotten a glimpse of her. (And man, how gnarly does the Borg Queen look now?)

Ah, there’s Tuvok, offering Seven her own ship. As Vulcan as ever.

In the grand scheme of things, this is still only the second most successful attack by the Borg on Earth. Sure, they get to Earth, bring down the planetary defense systems and attack cities directly, all while using Starfleet ships. But in “First Contact,” they actually went back in time and assimilated all of Earth before the pesky Enterprise crew initiated a do-over. And honestly, if Jean-Luc and his merry band hasn’t been able to rescue Earth from Evil Jack, they could have just done what they did last season or in “First Contact”: Go back in time. It’s easy!

Troi gets to drive the Enterprise D again. It went better than it did last time, when she crashed it.

Beverly is an admiral now? What a promotion, considering the decades she spent out of Starfleet running a rogue operation. I wonder if Riker, Geordi or any of the others were like, “Hey, what about us?”

Ed Speleers did an admirable job as Jack Crusher. It’s not easy to go toe-to-toe with Patrick Stewart, but Speleers fits in seamlessly as Beverly and Jean-Luc’s son. (While we’re here, what’s up with Jack’s brother, Wesley?)

I hope all of you stuck around for the post-credits scene. Q is still alive! Of course he is. We don’t acknowledge last season around these parts.

    "36" : """ Judging from “Little Richard: I Am Everything,” the best way to understand the self-proclaimed “architect of rock ’n’ roll” is through his contradictions.

In this documentary, directed by Lisa Cortés, Little Richard, who died in 2020, is seen as a musician who could simultaneously lay the groundwork for an entire genre and not get his due. Without him, we probably wouldn’t have the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, David Bowie or Prince — artists who were happy to cite his influence even as they stole his thunder and his style.

In the 1950s, he broke with the slower sounds of Ray Charles and B.B. King in favor of fast songs with lyrics not so subtly about sex. Yet over the years he seemed to have a conflicted relationship with his own sexuality. (He is shown in an early 1980s interview with David Letterman claiming both that he believed he was one of the first gay people to come out and that he was no longer gay.) He went from flamboyant rocker to gospel singer and back again.

“He was very, very good at liberating other people through his example,” the pop-music scholar Jason King says in the film. “He was not good at liberating himself.”

Mick Jagger, who credits Little Richard with teaching him how to work the whole stage, and John Waters, who says his mustache is a tribute, are among the famous faces here who testify to how he liberated them. “I Am Everything” also skews gratifyingly wonky for a pop-music bio-doc. The sociologist Zandria Robinson describes the cultural atmosphere in the South — a space, she says, for the different, the Gothic and the nonnormative — at the time Richard was formed as an artist. King describes Little Richard’s piano playing as a left hand of boogie-woogie and a right hand of Ike Turner-influenced percussion.

Little Richard himself, seen in a bounty of archival footage, gives good quotes — “everybody likes to go to orgies,” he says at one point. And even in decades-old video, his musical performances, like a rendition of “I Can’t Turn You Loose” at the 1989 induction of Otis Redding to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, are showstoppers.

Cortés tries a few things to upend the humdrum rock-doc template. She has musicians re-create breakout moments in Little Richard’s career, such as a night in the 1940s when Sister Rosetta Tharpe had him take the stage in Macon, Ga., or a spontaneous rendition of “Tutti Frutti,” before its lyrics were sanitized, at the Dew Drop Inn in New Orleans. (A montage depicts the song’s popularity as a cosmic explosion, even as Little Richard is shown complaining bitterly in an interview that Elvis and Pat Boone “sold more of ‘Tutti Frutti’ than I did.”) At the end of the day, though, “I Am Everything” is content to be a thorough, energetic, largely chronological appraisal, more interested in saluting a musical legend who shook things up than in shaking up conventions itself.

    "37": """ You can’t have “Carmen” without the color red.

In the choreographer Benjamin Millepied’s debut film — an adaptation of the classic story, previously told in prose by Prosper Mérrimée and more famously in opera by Georges Bizet — it’s there from the start, in the opening titles, the pedals of a rose, the title heroine’s shirt.

But nothing more than color signifies that this is a “Carmen” tale, that old psychosexual drama of a male soldier so seduced by a Spanish femme fatale, he forgets his duties and is driven to jealousy and murder. No, here Carmen is instead a young Mexican woman both headstrong and naïve, restless and searching — much like the film itself.

That is disappointing for a movie seemingly assembled from promise: in Millepied, an enterprising dance-maker who pioneered small-screen performance during the pandemic; in Nicholas Britell, a composer of knockout, earworm-rich soundtracks; in Rossy de Palma, an alluring, otherworldly fixture of Pedro Almodóvar films; and in Paul Mescal, a fast-rising, Oscar-nominated star capable of conveying swaths of biography and feeling in a sadly handsome smile.

They make for a film with elements of dance on camera, musical, of-the-moment melodrama and visual poetry — but without a thorough commitment to any one of those and few, if any, moments of coalescence. The screenplay is spare to the point of meager; characters speak in clichés, like claiming that music won’t pay the bills, and are divided, boringly, into categories of unequivocally good (Mexican immigrants mainly) and bad (all white characters except Mescal’s Aidan).

No dialogue, anyway, communicates more effectively than Britell’s soundtrack, a constant presence, tense and evocative, functioning like opera by fully integrating with, if not driving, the story rather than underscoring it. The movie also says more through movement than speech: percussive flamenco; climactic krumping in a fight sequence starring and set to an original song by the D.O.C.; a touching pas de deux of Carmen’s balletic fluidity and Aidan’s awkward, failing attempts to match her.

Little seems to keep this couple of lost souls — he a tormented war vet, she an undocumented Mexican immigrant on the run — together other than fear. As Carmen, Melissa Barrera is beautiful but somewhat blank, an obtuse mystery next to Mescal, his face having the shape and solemnity of a Roman statue, but eyes that repeatedly betray his pain. De Palma is a welcome source of levity as Masilda, a nightclub owner who tells Aidan that if she were younger she would eat him up like a plate of chilaquiles.

Masilda tells Carmen that her name means poem, that she is “the most beautiful poem made into a woman.” Yet much of the film’s poetry comes from the cinematography of Jörg Widmer — a veteran of Terrence Malick’s sweeping, awe-struck camera gestures — who renders a desert landscape expansive and entrapping, and finds wonder in the otherwise stressful tangle of Los Angeles freeways. Millepied relishes close-ups of bodies in motion, and scatters dreamy symbolism throughout the story, populating his world with angels of death.

Carmen and Aidan are connected, before they meet, by small flames that rise spontaneously from the ground. In the end, they are separated by tragedy. Their trajectory couldn’t be simpler, but this film, at nearly two aimless hours, doesn’t seem interested in, or capable of, that kind of focus.

    "38" : """ In the lurid 1973 dystopian thriller “Soylent Green,” Edward G. Robinson movingly played a man who embraced euthanasia, dying in a special chamber while being soothed by classical music. That story was set in 2022. “Plan 75,” the quietly bold debut feature of Chie Hayakawa, is on the same page, envisioning a more or less present-day version of Japan that hawks euthanasia services to the aged.

As macabre as that sounds, the conceit channels actual anxieties in Japan about providing for a growing population of seniors. The sober drama centers on a 78-year-old woman, Michi (Chieko Baisho), who still has her independence, her health and a karaoke-loving friend circle.

The government’s assisted suicide program seems like an over-advertised nuisance to Michi, until she loses her job and finds a friend slumped over dead. Life turns precarious, Michi grows isolated and Plan 75 — the name of the government program — starts to sounds appealing. We are also introduced to a Plan 75 clerk, Hiromu (Hayato Isomura), and a Filipino caretaker, Maria (Stefanie Arianne), who takes an unsavory gig with the program.

Hayakawa avoids slipping into satire or a stylized dystopia, making details like a euthanasia spa package seem plausible (and insidious). Yet a somnolence hangs over the film, and Hiromu and Maria are left somewhere between having full-fledged story lines and just being useful foils. Still, Baisho gets across the creeping despair that morbidity and the loss of community can create — a sensation that lets “Plan 75” double as a consummate entry in pandemic-era cinema.

    "39" : """ “Trenque Lauquen,” a wondrous multipart epic from the Argentine director Laura Citarella, opens with men on a quest. Laura (Laura Paredes), a visiting botanist working on research in Trenque Lauquen, a town southwest of Buenos Aires, has disappeared, leaving only a cryptic note behind: “Farewell, farewell. I’m leaving, I’m leaving.” Rafael (Rafael Spregelburd), Laura’s boyfriend, and Ezequiel (Ezequiel Pierri), her research colleague turned almost-lover, drive through the countryside, seeking her traces.

As the film unfolds across twelve chapters (split into two feature-length parts), the men’s pursuit grows like a wild, proliferating vine: Missing women multiply, and the film’s mysteries fork into new ciphers. Yet it’s only in the seventh chapter that someone questions the very premise of the search for Laura, asking Ezequiel, “What makes you think she wants to be found?”

“Trenque Lauquen” undermines the hubris of discovery — a distinctly masculine impulse, and a narrative principle we often take for granted. Produced by El Pampero Cine, an Argentine production company known for sprawling, Borgesian films like the more than 13-hour “La Flor” (2019), Citarella’s film posits that being lost can be a kind of liberation, and that mystery, in movies, can be an end in itself, rather than a path to a revelation. The first, six-chapter part alternates between two timelines and two quests: Rafael and Ezequiel’s search for Laura, and flashbacks to Ezequiel and Laura’s attempts to track down the identity of Carmen Zuna (played in fantasy sequences by Citarella), a schoolteacher who had a passionate affair with a local landowner in the 1960s. Laura finds their erotic love letters hidden away in books at the library and becomes enamored, her passion soon infecting Ezequiel.

The second chapter starts to illuminate the circumstances behind Laura’s disappearance, only to unwrap an entirely new puzzle: this time about two lesbian lovers in the suburbs who seem to be conducting a scientific experiment, secretly raising a mutant creature. Frankenstein comes to mind here and also as a metaphor for the film’s patchwork structure. Relayed through letters and notes in the first half, and Laura’s voice-over in the second, the many micro-stories that make up the narrative seem to take on lives of their own, crisscrossing and diverging unexpectedly. Familiar hints of horror and detective stories appear like red herrings, but the ultimate effect is of a campfire tale: The pleasure lies in the telling — the invention of fictions, the performance of emotions — rather than in the details of plot. Once you lose yourself in the thickets of “Trenque Lauquen,” you won’t want to be found.

    "40" : """ There are few living children’s authors who have connected as deeply to their readers as Judy Blume. That’s the argument of “Judy Blume Forever,” a new documentary from Davina Pardo and Leah Wolchok that pays unwavering tribute to Blume and her imprint on young adult literature. The film, streaming on Amazon Prime Video starting Friday, features the 85-year-old writer narrating the major milestones of her life and career, cut together with interviews of famous Blume acolytes such as the writer and director Lena Dunham, the comedian Samantha Bee, the writer Jacqueline Woodson and Anna Konkle, the co-creator of “PEN15.”

Since the publication of her breakthrough novel “Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret,” in 1970, while she was a young housewife in suburban New Jersey, Blume has maintained a fiercely devoted audience that has found enlightenment and understanding through her preteen and teenage characters. It’s not uncommon to hear fans of Blume’s work say that reading her books felt as though she was speaking directly to them through the pages. This is thanks, in no small part, to her frank discussion of mature themes that, at the time she was writing, were considered unusual for what we now call Y.A. novels: adolescent sexuality, religion, disability, bullying, and — in many of her books — the unfair expectations of purity and obedience that parents and society place on children.

“Judy Blume Forever” does a fine job of synthesizing the influences that Blume’s life had on her writing — in particular her father’s death when she was 21, as well as the marriage and divorce that inspired her first adult-oriented novel, “Wifey.” Blume, a longtime free-speech advocate, also has no qualms about drawing parallels between the Reagan-era book censorship campaigns she endured and the hundreds of attempts to ban books in just the past year.

In a successful showcase of what might be lost if Blume’s books were removed from libraries and schools, the film returns to one of the most compelling aspects of career: her correspondence with thousands of children, whose letters to her span 50 years and are now archived at Yale. Pardo and Wolchok interview two of Blume’s pen pals, now adults themselves, and their recounting of her impact on their lives encompasses some of the film’s most moving portions.

At times, “Judy Blume Forever” can resemble a highlight reel of Blume’s bibliography, with large sections dedicated to her books’ most memorable excerpts, such as the masturbation sequence in “Deenie.” Given her vast literary output, it’s hard to give complex stories like “Blubber” and “Forever” the nuance they deserve in a short documentary, especially one this preoccupied with showing Judy Blume the person, jogging on the beach and owning a small bookstore in Key West. Compared with her most obvious predecessor, Maurice Sendak, who led an intensely private life, Blume has always been an open book, despite the flurry of controversy around her. That may not make for the most exciting documentary, but it does make Blume herself even more endearing.

    "41" : """ You’ve heard of Quasimodo, the hunchback of Notre Dame, the actor Brian Cox announces at the start of “Quasi,” but you haven’t heard this version. And maybe you shouldn’t — unless, that is, you’re in a certain state of mind at a certain time of night. In “Quasi,” the latest film from the comedy troupe Broken Lizard, the disfigured peasant from the famed Victor Hugo novel is working in medieval torture chambers when he’s suddenly thrust into a web of murderous royal intrigue.

After the queen of France (Adrianne Palicki) takes a liking to Quasi, he finds himself at a dinner with the obnoxious king (Jay Chandrasekhar), who asks him to assassinate the pope (Paul Soter), a longtime rival. During the attempt, though, the pope asks Quasi to kill the king, leaving the hunchback in a bind.

The high-stakes political affair takes place with the goofy, lighthearted energy you’d expect from the comedy group behind “Super Troopers” and “Beerfest” (“Quasi” is directed by Kevin Heffernan, who stars in the film alongside the rest of the Broken Lizard troupe): It’s dumb fun that is at times entertaining, at times flat.

At the heart of this film is a thematic twist that would be at home in a Seth Rogen movie: a repressed bromance between Quasi and his “hut-mate,” Duchamp (Heffernan), both of whom refuse to admit they’re each other’s best friends. The parodic period-piece framework lends an added layer of whimsy and offbeat jokes to the Broken Lizard sensibility — though that is perhaps not enough to justify a film that can, at times, feel like a so-so sketch that didn’t warrant a feature. But you’ll most likely get a few laughs and mild enjoyment when you just surrender yourself to the inanity of it all.

    "42" : """ Someday, when conventional wisdom gives way to common sense, “Everybody Loves Raymond” will be recognized as one of the best network situation comedies. Incisively written and superbly acted, it explored with surgical precision the bottomless hostility animating passive-aggressive family dynamics. Ray Romano, whose standup comedy fueled the series’ themes, very successfully bridged the skill set of a standup comedian with that of an ensemble comedic actor. And yet. No respect, or not enough respect.

In any event, the series is now a thing of the past, and Romano is taking a turn behind the camera for his feature directing debut, “Somewhere in Queens,” which he co-wrote with Mark Stegemann. Here, Romano sticks to the outer-borough Italian American milieu of his series. The results are mixed.

Romano plays Leo Russo, a likable, “Rocky”-obsessed screw-up who’s the underdog of his dad’s family construction firm. His tough cookie wife, Angela (Laurie Metcalf), is recovering from cancer. Their only son, nicknamed Sticks (Jacob Ward), is recessively shy but fiercely talented at basketball. His gift might yield him a college scholarship and has already attracted Dani (Sadie Stanley), a free-spirited girl.

But when Sticks crowds Dani, things cool between the two. Leo, in a fit of desperation, approaches Dani with an appalling proposition that will continue the momentum of the young couple’s relationship and keep Sticks on track for his college tryout.

This genuinely discomfiting narrative material hits some raw nerves, and the cast, which also includes the great Tony Lo Bianco, doesn’t back down from emotional authenticity. But if you’ve been following the movie’s music choices, which contain a number of songs that are at least wet-noodle adjacent, you won’t be surprised that Romano eventually contrives soft, and arguably goofy, exits for his troubled characters.

    "43" : """ No royal heir in British history has waited longer than Charles III, the king formerly known as the Prince of Wales, to ascend the throne. When he is officially crowned, on May 6, Charles will be 74 years old — a full 47 years older than his mother, Elizabeth II, was at her own coronation way back in the mid-20th century.

A lot has changed in the monarchy, and in the monarch, since the early days of the queen’s reign. Elizabeth came to the top job through accidents of history and fate. Her uncle, Edward VIII, abdicated in 1936, disrupting the normal order of succession; her father, George VI, succeeded him but died 16 years later at the age of 56, propelling Elizabeth onto the throne. By contrast, Charles — the oldest Prince of Wales in British history to become king — was born a monarch-in-waiting and has had a lifetime to prepare.

The public in turn has had a lifetime to get to know Charles, starting from his rarefied childhood in the public eye. We had a ringside seat at his marriage to Diana, Princess of Wales, who died in 1997; we followed his affair with and eventual marriage to Camilla Parker Bowles; we saw his struggles with his second son, Prince Harry, in an ongoing saga that is bound to spill over into the coronation, which Harry is scheduled to attend without his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.

By tradition, heirs to the throne don’t meddle in unroyal matters. But Charles was an unusually outspoken Prince of Wales. He is known as a lover of classical music, a student of philosophy and world religions and a proponent of sometimes controversial ideas. He has often waded into debates on unexpected topics like alternative medicine and organic farming (pro) and modernist architecture (against).

In London alone, there are plenty of royal spots to visit (Kensington Palace and Westminster Abbey, for starters), royal-themed exhibits to explore (“The Royal Palace Experience” at Madame Tussauds) and coronation-themed walking tours through this most inviting of cities.

But for visitors interested in exploring the history and psyche of the new king, here are some stops on an alternative royal tour in and around the city.

Highgrove

Charles bought Highgrove House, a Georgian neo-Classical estate in Gloucestershire, in 1980, before he married Diana. He saw it as a refuge, a bolt-hole in which he could pursue country pleasures and contemplate the beauty of nature; she found it boring and preferred the city. More and more, it became the place where he arranged discreet trysts with Camilla Parker Bowles.

The house — reachable by bus from London, or by taking a train to Kemble, and then a taxi — is closed to outsiders. But the grounds are open for tours each April through October. Until the end of May, there’s also an exhibition at the Garrison Chapel in Chelsea, London, “Highgrove in Harmony: Exploring A Royal Vision,” that lets you appreciate the gardens without leaving the city.

The exhibition demonstrates how fully the gardens embody Charles’s philosophical and aesthetic preoccupations: his love of nature, his passion for tradition, his enthusiasm for artisanal crafts. There’s a winsome photo of him on his knees weeding, and several never-before-seen princely watercolors and sketches. Charles is said to have even personally planted much of the thyme in what is known as the Thyme Walk.

The gardens consist of a number of interconnected parts and you can see photographs of them all here, including the flower-dotted Wildflower Meadow, which Charles envisioned as imitating “the foreground in Botticelli’s great painting ‘Primavera.’” It’s farmed using traditional methods — scythed by hand and visited each autumn by Shropshire sheep. As Charles once said: “I never underestimate the value of the ‘golden hoof’ in the great scheme of biodiversity.”

Trinity College, Cambridge

When Charles was still an unhappy student in a remote Scottish boarding school, a high-level committee decreed that, in a break with tradition, he should continue his education instead of going directly into the military. Thus he became the first Prince of Wales ever to receive a university degree.

The young prince was sent to Trinity, the richest of Cambridge University’s 31 colleges. His life there was hardly normal. Isolated by temperament and position from most of the other students, Charles frequently repaired to the countryside for shooting weekends and to London for cultural and state functions. (He also studied for some months in Wales in preparation for his formal investiture as Prince of Wales at Caernarfon Castle, a medieval fortress in northwest Wales.) According to a contemporary report in The Times, Charles did give student life a go. He sang, acted, contributed to the university magazine, played polo against Oxford, took an evening pottery course and went on an archaeological dig with other students to the island of Jersey.

You can visit the princely academic habitat by taking the hour-or-so-long train ride from London to Cambridge; Trinity is a short cab ride into town. Founded by Henry VIII in 1546, the college is impressively grand, due in part to its reported 1.3 billion pounds in assets. (Its holdings include the O2 Arena in London and great swaths of the busy and lucrative Port of Felixstowe.)

Since the pandemic, Trinity’s awe-inspiring interior — including the Great Court; a famous statue of Henry VIII holding a chair leg that at some point replaced his original sword; and the library designed by Sir Christopher Wren and dating to 1695 — has, sadly, been closed to the public. But visitors can approach from the back, walking along a network of college-owned lawns across the Cam River, and peer in through the formidable gates. There the college porters, resplendent in bowler hats, will be happy to share royal and other tidbits.

The British Library

Charles, a devotee of traditional building materials and traditional buildings, has spent many years attacking what he sees as the scourge of modernist architecture. In 1984, he managed to offend many members of the London architectural establishment by denouncing their work in a speech to the Royal Institute of British Architects.

His interventions had a knock-on effect, causing the cancellation of some of the buildings he singled out for particular scorn. Some of the casualties: a planned extension to the National Gallery, which Charles compared to a “monstrous carbuncle”; a Mies van der Rohe-designed building that he called “a giant glass stump”; and three projects by Richard Rogers, the modernist architect who died in 2021. “You have to give this much to the Luftwaffe,” Charles said, referring to one of Mr. Rogers’s proposals. “When it knocked down our buildings, it didn’t replace them with anything more offensive than rubble.”

Charles’s biggest bête noire was the British Library, an epic project designed by the architect Colin St. John Wilson that cost more than $700 million and took 36 years from inception to completion, and that he said looked like a “dim collection of sheds groping for some symbolic significance.” (For good measure, he compared its reading room to “the assembly hall of an academy for secret police.”)

The library opened in 1998 and was an instant hit, though most people agree that the building’s pedestrian red brick exterior does a disservice to the majestic interior, with its cunning deployment of multiple levels, soaring spaces and beautiful use of light. Its centerpiece is the King’s Library, a leather- and vellum-bound collection that rises up in a six-story glass bookcase at the building’s core.

The library is now a buzzy and vibrant cultural center thrumming with life. Some of its greatest treasures are displayed in its dedicated exhibition space. (Asked for a recommendation on a recent visit, a staff member said he quite liked the Magna Carta.)

Mr. St. John Wilson never really recovered from all the criticism, though he was knighted in 1998. He died in 2007, at 85. Eight years later, the library was designated a Grade I-listed building, Britain’s highest heritage honor.

The Ritz

London is full of Charles-related locations, as you might expect. There is Clarence House, where he and soon-to-be-crowned Queen Camilla lived for many years. There is Hill House in West London, where he went to elementary school, and the Tower of London, where many of his family’s jewels are on display. (It’s currently without the Imperial State Crown and Queen Mary’s Crown, which are being used in the coronation.)

And there is the Ritz hotel, the scene of the historic occasion when Charles and Camilla emerged from the shadows of their extramarital affair and appeared in public as a couple for the first time. All they did was leave a party and briefly stand outside. But this was the moment, as The Independent newspaper put it at the time, when “15 seconds of blinding flashbulbs ended at least 12 years of ducking and diving.”

The year was 1999, four years after Diana threw a grenade into the royal myth by declaring that “there were three of us in this marriage” — meaning she, Charles and Camilla. The couple divorced in 1996; Diana’s fatal car accident took place the following summer. The appearance at the Ritz was the beginning of Camilla’s integration into Charles’s public life, culminating in the couple’s marriage, in 2005.

The Ritz is as stately a venue for a romantic coming-out as it is possible to be. Situated on the corner of Green Park on Piccadilly, it evokes old-school opulence and over-the-top obsequious hospitality.

Nonroyal visitors can eat in the Michelin-starred restaurant (sample dinner entree: Dover sole for 68 pounds, or about $85); sip cocktails at the Rivoli Bar, or take afternoon tea, for 70 pounds apiece, in the grand foyer. Pro tip: Wear something nice, get a good blowout and leave your fanny pack at home. However you look, you will feel frumpy compared to everyone else.

Poundbury

Nestled at one end of Dorchester in Dorset, southwest England, Poundbury is the embodiment of the king’s singular Weltanschauung, a community built from scratch on 400 acres of farmland owned by the Duchy of Cornwall, the royal estate. With some 4,600 residents, it’s a royal experiment in contemporary living meant to “break the mold of conventional housing,” Charles once said.

Poundbury’s central hub is named Queen Mother Square, after Charles’s late grandmother; the main pub-cum-hotel is called the Duchess of Cornwall Inn, after his wife. But mostly the town is an exercise in soft-power royalty. The traditional building materials, the human-scale architecture, the master plan by the modernist-eschewing Luxembourgish architect Léon Krier, the harmonious aesthetic in the prettily painted front doors, the artisanal shops — all these reflect Charles’s values and philosophy.

Take the train to Dorchester South, hop on a bus to Poundbury and disembark at the square, identifiable by the huge Queen Mother statue. Walk down the street in any direction to get the feel of the place.

Here classic townhouses intermingle with apartment buildings and free-standing one-family homes, interspersed with squares, tiny parks and cunningly constructed courtyards and alleys that convey an air of openness and connection. There is no litter. There are few pedestrians and very little noise.

Poundbury’s residents are zealous converts to this way of living. Outsiders have been less enthusiastic. The town has been compared to a Potemkin village, to Brigadoon, to a “feudal Disneyland” and to the town in the movie “The Truman Show.”

To judge for yourself, shop at the garden center for flowers and horticultural accouterments. Eat at one of the quaint nearby cafes, like the Potting Shed, with its many sorts of olives. Buy some artisanal bread at Finca in a grand building known as the Buttercross, catch up on town gossip at the Buttermarket convenience store, which doubles as the post office, or indulge in a spa treatment at Pure Beauty.

Farther afield

You won’t find Charles featured on the website of Gordonstoun, the remote Scottish boarding school his father, Prince Philip, forced him to attend and which he once referred to as “Colditz in kilts,” referring to the prisoner-of-war camp run by the Nazis. But it happens to be surrounded by extraordinarily beautiful (if often wet and cold) countryside, and is near, among other things, the lovely 13th-century market town of Elgin.

As befitting his former role as Prince of Wales, Charles has a residence in Wales: Llwynywermod, near Mydffai, a tiny village near the Brecon Beacons National Park. It’s closed to the public, but visitors really yearning for royal experiences can choose from two vacation cottages — North Range and West Range — available for rent on the property.

    "44" : """ Mentor-mentee relationships have nourished generations of artists, especially those who were not provided formal training or welcomed by established gatekeepers — and in male-dominated fields, the support between women has long served as a kind of shadow academy, anointing and ushering in the next wave of talent. The concept of a mentorship, though, as seen in the examples below, is widely variable. Some mentors are also friends, though a close connection is not always necessary. Sometimes, all it takes is a word of encouragement at the right time to alter the course of cultural history.

Judy Chicago (b. 1939) and Anaïs Nin (1903-77)

When Judy Chicago met Anaïs Nin at a party in the summer of 1971, she had just finished reading Nin’s diary, which became a sensation among American women for its frank discussions of sex, psychoanalysis and ambition. Chicago, then 32, had recently published a revealing essay of her own, entitled “My Struggle as a Woman Artist.” “It was the first time I had ever tried to write about it,” she says. She was floored when Nin walked up and told her how much she had enjoyed it. At the time, Chicago was paralyzed by the volume of her own ideas. “Anaïs gave me this incredible piece of advice. She said: ‘You can’t live out all these possibilities. But you can write your way through them. You should write a book.’” That was the push Chicago needed to write her 1975 autobiography, “Through the Flower”; Nin wrote the introduction. According to Chicago, they only disagreed on one thing: the value of anger. “She didn’t think it was appropriate,” Chicago says. “I felt the opposite.”

Misty Copeland (b. 1982) and Raven Wilkinson (1935-2018)

Misty Copeland was already almost a decade into her career at the American Ballet Theater when she first became aware of Raven Wilkinson’s existence. One night in 2010 at home, she was watching the 2005 documentary “Ballets Russes,” half-paying attention, when, out of the corner of her eye, she saw a woman of color auditioning before a row of white men. That woman was Raven Wilkinson, the first Black ballerina in the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. As it turns out, the two lived a block apart in New York City. Wilkinson, who danced with a white ballet company before fleeing the segregated South for Europe in the 1950s, would become Copeland’s mentor until her death in 2018. In her 2022 memoir, “The Wind at My Back,” Copeland writes, “Raven taught me through her example that, as they say, ‘When and where I enter, the whole race enters with me’ is not a burden and a pressure but a promise of possibility.”

Doris Lessing (1919-2013) and Jenny Diski (1947-2016)

Warmth and encouragement did not define the relationship between the writers Doris Lessing and Jenny Diski. The Nobel Prize-winning author invited the then-15-year-old Diski to live with her in London on the suggestion of her son, who was Diski’s boarding-school classmate. Fleeing abusive parents, Diski was immediately seduced by the house’s consistency, stocked fridge and churn of visiting intellectuals. She knew she wanted to be a writer. But during the four years they lived together, Lessing never offered notes or advice; anything Diski learned was through observation and osmosis. The two made a pact never to write about each other — and, fittingly, both broke their word. Diski-like characters appear in Lessing’s novels “Memoirs of a Survivor” (1974) and “The Sweetest Dream” (2001). After Lessing’s death in 2013 and Diski’s own terminal cancer diagnosis, she wrote “In Gratitude” (2016), a brutal memoir about their relationship. “There was no hope of ever being right,” Diski writes, “as Doris was right.”

Kathy Acker (1947-97) and Karen Finley (b. 1956)

The term “mentor” is a bit too clinical and hierarchical to fully encapsulate Karen Finley’s relationship with Kathy Acker. The pathbreaking artists met in the late 1970s, when Acker was a visiting teacher and Finley was a grad student at the San Francisco Art Institute. “Boundaries in the classroom weren’t the same as they are now,” Finley says. On the first day of class, Finley went to Acker’s home; they attended parties, readings and performances together. For Finley, grad school was about being inducted into a vocation — first as a student, then as a colleague and finally as a friend and co-conspirator. Acker offered that. She also encouraged Finley, who is now a professor at N.Y.U.’s Tisch School for the Arts, to pursue experimental, dislocated writing alongside performance. Acker’s “belief that, as a woman at that time, I was expected to be talented, that I would be a contributor, was very meaningful to me,” Finley says, “and I think it’s also a reason I am in education today.”

Pat Parker (1944-89) and Audre Lorde (1934-92)

Parker and Lorde’s relationship was part-mentorship, part-sisterhood. Over the course of 15 years, the pair exchanged letters (Parker lived in Oakland, Calif., and Lorde, New York) about poetry, activism, Black lesbian identity and motherhood. Each paid tribute to the other in her work, including Parker’s poem “For Audre,” in which she wrote: “My muse sang of you— / watch the sky for / an ebony meteorite / that will pierce / into your darkness / illuminate your fears / hurl them at you / laughing.” They also supported each other through treatment for breast cancer, with which they were diagnosed almost 10 years apart (Lorde in 1977, Parker in 1988). Upon learning of Parker’s illness, Lorde wrote: “You are a survivor, Pat, and that battle on a physical level is now braided into our lives, but the war is not alien, now is it? You and me we’ve been fighting all our lives.” Their intimate correspondence is captured in the 2018 book​ “Sister Love: The Letters of Audre Lorde and Pat Parker 1974-1989.”

Joni Mitchell (b. 1943) and Brandi Carlile (b. 1981)

Brandi Carlile first heard Joni Mitchell’s music when she was in her 20s. She didn’t love it. Still coming to terms with her queerness, she felt Mitchell’s songs were too feminine to resonate with her. But when Carlile’s wife, Catherine Shepherd, reintroduced her to the music a few years later, it hit differently. Mitchell’s songs helped her realize “I had spent too long equating vulnerability and weakness with femininity,” Carlile wrote in the Times of London. In 2018, three years after Mitchell suffered a life-threatening brain aneurysm, Carlile performed at her 75th birthday concert. After Mitchell mentioned how much she missed hearing her own instruments played, Carlile began organizing Joni Jams, monthly jam sessions at Mitchell’s Bel Air home. It was these freewheeling gatherings that encouraged the 79-year-old icon to return to the stage. She surprised the world (and her own band) when she took the mic alongside Carlile at the Newport Folk Festival last summer. What started out as a star-studded tribute set transitioned — at first tentatively, then enthusiastically, with grins, tears and a roaring audience — into Mitchell’s first full-blown live performance in 20 years.

Yayoi Kusama (b. 1929) and Georgia O’Keeffe (1887-1986)

“If she had not so kindly answered my clumsy and reckless letter to her, I am not sure I would ever have made it to America,” the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama told the Tate of the painter Georgia O’Keeffe. “I knew that only in New York could I become a star.” The two artists, born 42 years apart, met only once in person. But as a young artist in Matsumoto, Kusama came across O’Keeffe’s work in a book and boldly wrote to ask her advice. Intrigued by the Japanese return address, O’Keeffe replied — and encouraged Kusama to move to New York and show her work to “anyone” who might be interested. Over the years, the elder artist repeatedly invited Kusama to visit her in New Mexico. Kusama always declined.

Frida Kahlo (1907-54) and Fanny Rabel (1922-2008)

Frida Kahlo did not teach people how to paint. Instead, as her student Fanny Rabel told Kahlo’s biographer Hayden Herrera, she taught them how to live and how to look. Rabel was the only female member of Los Fridos, a group of four artists who studied with Kahlo until her death at the age of 47. (The others were Arturo Garcia Bustos, Guillermo Monroy and Arturo Estrada.) Kahlo sought out opportunities for her protégés, like a commission to paint the exterior of La Rosita, a tavern down the street from her Mexico City home and studio, Casa Azul. Rabel — a Polish Jewish artist who moved to the capital as a teenager — also assisted Kahlo’s husband, Diego Rivera, on his famed murals for the National Palace. With a particular interest in depicting Indigenous women and families, Rabel became the most prominent woman in the otherwise macho Mexican Muralist movement.

Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1806-61) and Mary Russell Mitford (1787-1855)

Sometimes the mentee’s legacy eclipses that of the mentor. This was the case with the Victorian poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Mary Russell Mitford, a then-established chronicler of rural English life almost 20 years Browning’s senior. Mitford served as a maternal figure to Browning, coaching her through the publication of her book “The Seraphim, and Other Poems” (1838) and supporting her as she grieved the deaths of two of her brothers in close succession. (In addition to arranging flower deliveries, Mitford reportedly gave Browning one of her own spaniel’s puppies.) Their relationship wasn’t without disputes — Mitford wasn’t an immediate fan of Elizabeth’s husband, the poet Robert Browning, and Elizabeth was scandalized that, after her brother died, Mitford wrote about his accidental drowning in the book “Recollections of a Literary Life” (1852). But they remained close until Mitford’s death in 1855.

Rosalba Carriera (1673-1757) and Felicità Sartori (circa 1714-60)

It was unusual to be a female artist in the 18th century; it was even more unusual to be a wildly successful one. But Rosalba Carriera, nicknamed the Queen of Pastel, was sought after by kings and aristocrats across Europe. Raised in Venice, she never married and developed a flourishing, all-female studio that specialized in selling miniatures (which sometimes bordered on erotica) to Grand Tour travelers. She was also famously generous with other female artists, offering support, training and encouragement. One of her favorite apprentices was Felicità Sartori, who executed both pastels and miniatures, frequently making copies of Carriera’s work for sale. Sartori also posed for her mentor; a circa 1740 portrait in which she dons a Turkish-inspired robe and a flirty smirk is now in the collection of the Uffizi.

    "45" : """ Naomi Watts: Elle impressed me the first time we met [while making the 2015 film “3 Generations,” in which Watts plays the mother of Fanning’s character]. She was 16, but with such emotional intelligence. When I was trying to get my start in my late 20s, I was already being told I was too late. They said, “You’d better get going. You’ve got only seconds left!” I think that’s changed — for the better, obviously. We’re now seeing women in their 50s carry films. There even seems to be a bit more movement in the opposite direction, like aging is suddenly trending.

With women, but never with men, “ambition” always gets labeled an ugly word. I’ve always been hungry, and that’s what got me here. I spent many years under the radar, not getting jobs — just tiny bits here and there — until David Lynch gave me an incredible role [in 2001’s “Mulholland Dr.”]. Had I not maintained that level of determination or ambition, whatever you want to call it, I would have packed it in and just tried to find something else. Knowing why you love what you do is important. What’s feeding you that makes you keep coming back for more?

Elle Fanning: Naomi’s kind of genre-less; it’s her own path that she’s forged. That’s what I hope people will one day say about my work. I always want to surprise people and push against what they think I can do.

When I was shooting the first season of “The Great” [the Hulu series that premiered in 2020, and that will soon air its third season, with Fanning playing Catherine the Great], it was also my first time producing a show. I hadn’t been behind the scenes much before, making those decisions, but I’d always been curious about how everything’s put together. Now I can feel myself evolving, not being as afraid to speak up in rooms that I wouldn’t normally be in. I’m still young, but I keep having to remind myself, “You’ve been acting since you were 2 — you’ve been on a lot of film sets, and you’ve seen a lot of things.”

    "46" : """ Cheryl “Salt” James: I remember Issa creating a Kickstarter account in 2011 to raise money so she could finish the first season of her YouTube series “The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl” (2011-13). That always struck me as savvy and bold. I had the privilege of watching her build her audience, then take them with her to HBO for “Insecure.”

When you’re an artist, people are always questioning your vision. Ideas can get stretched and pulled in different directions, and they can become diluted. Issa has always, from what I can see, followed her gut.

Sandra “Pepa” Denton: In her memoir [2015’s “The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl”], Issa mentions struggling with not feeling Black enough. I can relate to that. When Salt-N-Pepa was selling millions of records, they called us “crossover,” which meant that we weren’t Black or hip enough. Now everyone wants to be pop. It means you’ve gone global. Like us, Issa stayed strong and was smart about her struggle, turning it into comedy. She kept it real, too.

Issa Rae: I grew up on Salt-N-Pepa. I’ve always admired their collaboration as partners and the way they complement each other. It’s so hard for a group to last in this business, but they continue to be unapologetic about who they are and what they’re about. So much of my inspiration as a writer comes from female rappers. I write to rap music. When I was in middle school, I even tried to start rap groups because of Salt-N-Pepa. I had no business doing that, but they made me think I could.

I found my voice as an artist when, as a teenager, I realized I could tell stories that either made people laugh or feel something. With my web series “The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl,” there’s so much of me on camera — my sensibilities and sense of humor are on full display — and having the validation of that being what launched my career was both so scary and fulfilling. It took me a while to realize that it was my voice I was introducing to the world.

    "47" : """ In Eoghan Walls’s THE GOSPEL OF ORLA (236 pp., Seven Stories, paperback, $16.95), the flinty 14-year-old protagonist runs away from home and finds God — in the form of a “mad hairy” guy wrapped in a blanket who steals her bike. Enraged and afraid, she pulls a pocketknife and demands his name.

“Jesus?” she asks, when he tells her. “Jesus bloody Jesus like the Jesus Jesus?” He nods.

Her bike gone, Orla must return home to her widowed father and toddler sister in the North England village of Glasson Dock. But she’s determined to hatch a new plan. It’s unfair that her grieving dad gets to do what he wants, which is drink; what Orla wants is to steal and skip class and get out of there. When Jesus returns her bike, she shows him how to use an iPhone — he pokes and scrolls, transfixed — and it turns out he’s the real deal: a genuine miracle-worker who raises her cat from the dead. She sees possibility. She persuades him to run off to Ireland with her and try to resurrect her mom.

As coming-of-age stories go, “The Gospel of Orla” is winningly off-kilter. Walls refuses easy sentimentality, and the story is brisk and surprising, perfectly paced. Orla’s irreverence is beguiling — “Everyone was all so nicey nice after Mum died even Suzie B who is a two-face slag” — and her sense of injustice buoying. We don’t live forever: Orla is right to find this deeply messed up. Walls’s marvelous novel asks what we might look for by way of consolation. A miracle shouldn’t be too much to ask.

“Forget what you know about mermaids,” beseeches teenage Ren, the narrator of Jade Song’s debut, CHLORINE (237 pp., Morrow, $30). “You think mermaids have no power.” To be fish-bodied, Ren insists, is to be almighty.

Song’s harrowing novel subverts the standards of merfolk lore — clamshell bras, underwater kingdoms, the love of a sailor or prince. “For too long you’ve been inundated by G-rated fairy tales,” Ren says. She is not beneficent or seductive; she’s ruthless and mutilated.

When she’s still human, the fastest on her swim team and the favorite of her lascivious coach, Ren is lonely. Her dad returns to China to build a business: “What is it called when immigrants reverse,” Ren wonders, “when they wake up from the nightmare masked as a dream?” Ren asks when he’ll come back, and he promises, “As soon as you go under a minute in the 100 freestyle.” Ren’s mom exerts pressure, too, urging her to impress Ivy League recruiters.

Ren finds a friend in Cathy, who, in a splendidly uncomfortable moment, helps her insert a tampon. Cathy alone treasures Ren whether she wins or loses, has two legs or a tail. Cathy’s love letters to Ren, overwrought in that adolescent way, are threaded throughout the book.

Her mind warped by stress, Ren decides the only way to be the best is to transform herself. Her metamorphosis is horrifying, but only for the reader: “Mermaids relish pain,” she says. Change requires a little agony, Ren shows us. Delusion, too.

“The mermaid has to die,” a screenwriter tells Penny, the narrator of Julia Langbein’s sublime AMERICAN MERMAID (329 pp., Doubleday, $28), who has also written a novel called “American Mermaid.” Penny has left Connecticut and a low-paid teaching job she loved to make a go of it in Hollywood, adapting her surprise best seller for the screen. Killing Sylvia, her formidable mermaid protagonist, would be a major departure from her novel.

The show’s writers have also decided they need to eroticize the asexual Sylvia. “There’s just no way to sexualize a fish,” Penny tells them. “She’s going to have to win your interest some other way.” The writers — both men — are pigheaded and tactless; their conversations with Penny are very funny. In an extended, riotous text thread about merfolk sex, they somehow bring in Saoirse Ronan, Ina Garten and “semen soup.” Their humiliating proposed tagline for the trailer: “FIRST. WAVE. FEMINISM.”

Langbein intertwines Penny’s story with chapters from her own novel, and this book-within-a-book structure allows us to mourn the gap between the novel Penny has written and the version she’s told will make a good movie. (“It’s my story,” she bemoans to her shark of an agent. “Not really,” the agent responds. “You sold it.”) The writers confront Penny about major changes made to the master script; Penny, who can’t account for them, starts to suspect Sylvia has come alive to edit the screenplay and reclaim her fate. Langbein’s novel considers how we decide who owns a story — and, far more compelling, how we know when a story succeeds.

The epigraph for Anna Metcalfe’s eerie and mesmerizing debut, CHRYSALIS (259 pp., Random House, $27), comes from Vladimir Nabokov, who was obsessed with butterflies. After emerging from the cocoon, Nabokov writes, “the butterfly sees the world, the large and awful face of the gaping entomologist.” The comma is suggestive: For the watched, the watcher is both of the world, and the world itself.

Metcalfe splits her novel among three first-person narrators, each of whom closely observes the same unnamed woman — a fitness influencer who posts “Still Life” videos in which she holds poses for hours. The first vantage point is Elliot’s: He goes to her gym and watches her lift weights, entranced by her self-possession. We hear, too, from the woman’s mother, Bella, who recounts how badly she wanted her mercurial daughter to need her when she was younger. The final section belongs to the influencer’s friend Susie, who helped the woman through a bad breakup, and now watches her videos and reads all the comments.

“Do you really need the people in your life,” the woman asks her followers, “or do they need you?” She advocates radical solitude: “Cut yourself off.” People go wild for the excuse to be selfish in the name of self-care. The woman coins hokey terms like “lonefulness” and “alonement,” and soon her followers start disappearing: They give up their lives and take to the woods to seek quiet and stillness.

“Chrysalis” is a thrilling look at how we spin silk around ourselves by watching the world on our screens. We are the gaping entomologist; we are the pupa, always a little stuck.

    "48" : """ Howardena Pindell: Melissa uses the techniques of traditional Navajo weaving, but then she does something that I can’t even imagine being able to do: She weaves intuitively, so the pattern is born as she works. My art has a lot of minutiae, like hers, and another connection is that the pieces she makes are often associated with Germantown Revival-style blankets [originally woven from yarn sent from mills in Germantown, Pa., to the Navajo reservations in the mid-19th century]. I grew up in Germantown during Jim Crow. It was not what you’d call an ideal place to be if you were of color.

Melissa is someone whose ancestors, whose nation, have been through hell. It was much worse than the plight of Black people in Germantown. It was actually Asiba Tupahache, a member of the Matinecoc Nation and activist from Long Island, who unlocked the part of my brain that was speechless but still feeling the hurt of racism. Hearing her speak the way she did about how Indigenous people were treated helped me find my own voice.

Melissa Cody: I started looking at Howardena’s paintings because the color theory behind her compositions is just so eye-catching and evokes so much emotion. I was really grasping for how to incorporate layers of emotion through color in my own textiles. I work on a traditional Navajo loom, so once a piece is complete, I can’t go back and remake it. It’s in its final state. I really appreciate Howardena’s work because it also has that sense of completion and finality. You can see when she’s able to call her piece finished.

I’m a fifth-generation textile artist. My career has been fostered not only by my relatives — my aunts, my mother, my grandmothers and my great-grandmothers — but also by other women who’re weavers in the Navajo Nation. Learning from family, you feel the ambience of such a wealth of knowledge. I was very, very lucky to have been around that. Now, my generation is taking weaving to the next path — bringing it into a fine-art setting, and also using it as a tool to teach our people’s history.

    "49" : """ Joan Baez: In 2019, Lana, whom I’d heard about from my granddaughter, Jasmine, invited me to sing with her in Berkeley. I said, “Why? Your audience could be my great-grandchildren.” And she said, “They don’t deserve you.”

Lana and I are sort of opposites. When I was starting out, I wouldn’t let anyone else onstage. I had two microphones — one for me, one for my guitar — and I stood barefoot, singing sad folk songs. I didn’t even write for the first 10 years, and she’s a songwriter.

I stopped singing three years ago; it was time to move on. After 60 years as a musician, I started painting. An artist friend said I need to loosen up and make mistakes so, if a painting isn’t working out, I dunk it twice in the swimming pool to see if it becomes something interesting. A hose will also do.

If people want to learn from me, I tell them to look beyond the music to my engagement with human and civil rights. My voice was what it was, but the real gift was using it. A documentary has just been made about me [“Joan Baez I Am a Noise,” 2023]. There’s footage of me marching with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Grenada, Miss., in 1966. At another point in the film, I mention in a letter to my parents that I want to save the world. Lana doesn’t make such grand political statements — at Berkeley, she brought me out to do it for her. And yet, amid the colorful chaos and glitter of her show, she was at one point, I believe, barefoot.

Lana Del Rey: I was having a show at Berkeley three years ago and wanted Joan to sing “Diamonds & Rust” (1975) with me. She told me she lived an hour south of San Francisco, and that if I could not only find her but also sing the song’s high harmonies on the spot, she’d do it. I was given a vague map to get to a house distinguishable only by its color and the chickens running in the yard. At one point during my audition, she stopped me with a steely look to let me know I didn’t get it right. By the end, she said, “OK, that’s good. I’ll sing with you.”

Midway through the performance, I said to the audience, “I have someone coming onstage who is the most generous-of-spirit singer I know, and the most important female singer of the ’60s and ’70s, and we’re gonna do ‘Diamonds & Rust’ together.” After the show, we went to an Afro-Caribbean two-step club, and she told me not to stop dancing until she did. That’s what my song “Dance Till We Die” (2021) is about.

I think the secret to real success is to make sure you’re always emotionally intact. I learned that from Joan. I recently said to her, “I just want you to know that I’m keenly aware that, in this lifetime or any other, I have no right to be standing shoulder to shoulder with you.” And she replied, “Oh, shut up.”

    "50" : """ Gina Prince-Bythewood: When Thuso first auditioned for “The Woman King,” I thought, “This is Nawi” [one of the film’s leads, a warrior in training], but there were still other people she had to meet with, so I said, “Good luck with your career.” We laugh about it now, but to her that sounded like a death knell. Once we were on set, my admiration for her only grew. You see her going toe-to-toe with Viola [Davis] and Lashana Lynch. Plus I could give her harder and harder fight elements — she’s someone who has the desire to be great and who puts the work in until she is. In the big Oyo battle, her character has this sequence with a machete tied to a rope that I didn’t know how we were going to do without a stunt double. Well, Thuso learned it. She took that rope everywhere with her.

We filmed in South Africa, her home country, and it was important for her to go back to her school to allow these young women to see what’s possible. That same impulse is a big part of who I am. When you get into this position, there’s nothing special about being the only one in the room — it’s partly on us to hold the door open and pull others through.

One thing I tell young filmmakers is that your first film should speak to who you are. When I got out of school, I tried to write a script that mirrored what was being made at the time, but there was this other story in my head, a personal one about a little Black girl who wanted to be the first woman in the N.B.A. That was the one only I could tell.

Thuso Mbedu: “Love & Basketball” (2000) is a rite-of-passage movie. Whenever I posted about “The Woman King,” I made it clear that it had the same director — and the comments that would come back! A lot of friends went on about how it spoke to them as teenagers who were brilliant at their sport and didn’t conform to commonly held ideas about femininity. I was average in sports, so when I got the role of Nawi, I put myself in Muay Thai. Gina joined me in my sessions, so we bonded before we even got to set, and we still train together now. She’s an athlete, so she’s got that competitive edge, and I just say, “Yeah, Gina, you win.”

Before working with her, I’d only ever done TV series, so she helped me understand a new space — with a film, you’re shooting fewer scenes but spending more time on them, and you can deplete yourself emotionally very quickly if you’re not smart about it. She’s also helped me navigate the industry, reminding me to know my worth because we’re in a system that will undermine you if you don’t.

    "51" : """ Tourmaline: My mentorship philosophy is about supporting what’s already there. Xoài produces culture that’s distinct and profound through her advocacy work with the Transgender Law Center and her projects in fashion, art and television. Her desire to create across arenas reminds me of my own.

My work is about time travel. I’m trying to tune in to the dreams of freedom of those who came before and feel how they’re still shaping this moment, and also into future versions of myself ushering in what’s possible. Because of that, I think of legacy in a nonlinear way, like time folding in on itself.

A lot of people have had their hands in molding my life. Both of my parents were community organizers who met in the 1967 Detroit riot. I was mothered, in many ways, by my friend Miss Major, a Black trans woman who lives in Little Rock, Ark., and was at the Stonewall riots.

There’s this idea that it’s the older person who mentors the younger person, but I’m being mentored all the time by friends who are younger. Xoài’s unapologetic writing about sex, nightlife and friendship inspires me to turn down the voice in my head that tells me what I can or cannot embody or portray. I’m most connected to my power when I feel the lightest, plugged into all of who I am.

Xoài Phạm: As a trans woman of color born to Vietnamese refugees in Orange County, Calif., I didn’t have many elders or mentors. Growing up, I never thought I could work in the film industry as a writer or an actor. I wasn’t encouraged to dream. Through my work and the discovery of myself, I’ve given myself permission to do so.

Tourmaline and I had known each other for a while, but it wasn’t until I received the Queer|Art mentorship last year that I got to work with her closely: I was writing a screenplay that was pulling from a lineage of stories about female friendship. There are countless examples centering on four women: “The Golden Girls,” “Sex and the City,” “Waiting to Exhale.” I was coming from that perspective but highlighting the sisterhood that’s so sacred to trans women, which has rarely been seen on television — what it means to be in this messy, unhinged relationship with others who are dealing with emotional baggage and hormonal changes. Trans women hold each other accountable and lift each other up.

But what I’ve really taken from Tourmaline is the knowledge that life is bigger than work. We gossip. She asks about my love life. We owe it to ourselves to enjoy our lives and seek pleasure. That’s always going to be more important than anything we create, because our lives are our own creations, as well.

    "52" : """ Emily Watson: I see a quality in Aisling that I recognized in myself as a young actor: She draws you in. On the set of “God’s Creatures” [the family drama in which they co-star], I found myself watching her a lot. It’s such a skill to be able to quietly hold all that emotion and let it dribble out.

Robert Altman said making movies is like building a sand castle on the beach — then you sit back in a deck chair with a beer and watch the tide take it away. You can feel very alive with a project. But each one comes to an end, and you sort of sink back into not knowing who you are. I have a network of younger actors I like to look out for because it can be confoundingly lonely. You can lose yourself in something, and then bang, it’s done, and everyone’s gone.

I’ve been through phases when I’ve felt like a leading lady and then, five minutes later, I’m playing a mum in a bonnet. There was a time for me, before the landscape of television started evolving, when I thought, “Is this it?” But when I hit 50, instead of being put out to pasture, I noticed things started getting interesting. Actresses get so much better when they stop trying to be sexy.

Aisling Franciosi: I’ve always thought of Emily’s career as a road map: She’s an actor’s actor, an artist. Putting the quality of the work first isn’t necessarily the thing that gives you the most visibility. When I did “The Nightingale” [a 2018 historical thriller set in an early 19th-century Tasmanian penal colony], I wanted to prove I could do more than just play a teenager. I think it’s a powerful film, and I remember not caring what anyone thought because I was so proud of it. But I’d be lying if I said it did what some people thought it was going to do for my career. It’s become a running joke in my family — the number of times over the past decade I’ve been called the “star of tomorrow” or “one to watch.”

So much of this industry is driven by the hot new thing. Entering my 30s, I am not, objectively speaking, the hot new thing. My ambition now is just to be able to make a living as an actor for as long as I can.

    "53" : """Paula Vogel: In my advanced playwriting class at Brown, there was an exercise where I asked people to write a play with a dog as protagonist, and Sarah wrote about the dog waiting for the family to return home after her father’s funeral. That was my introduction to her — on the page. I remember weeping at the end of the five pages, running into the next room and handing them to my wife, who also started to cry. I looked at her and said, “This woman is going to be a household name.” And then I discovered she was 20.

What’s followed has been 30 years of exchanging writers, books, first drafts. I’m always perplexed when people teach writing and they ask the writers to be insular. Every time we write a play, we’re talking back to Aristotle: We shape the clay of our own work by responding to colleagues who are no longer with us. It’s a much different path for women playwrights — things that our male colleagues like Tom Stoppard or Tony Kushner may get praised for (using poetic language; challenging an audience emotionally) often get resisted when a woman’s voice presents those same virtues.

I worry that we toss away women writers when we reach a certain age, when we’re no longer new and young. There’s a fear of disappearing, so you push a play out before it’s ready. When I ran the playwriting programs at Brown and Yale, I was trying to write despite that 60-to-80-hour-a-week teaching schedule; there are a lot of plays I wish I had held onto longer.

I guess I’m trying to model persistence. Sarah doesn’t need my modeling; she has it. But this is the period in women’s careers — middle age — when we lose a lot of artists. I want my legacy to be, and I think it has been, giving people enough skills that they can support playwriting for their lifetimes.

Sarah Ruhl: Paula was the reason I started writing plays, and the reason I kept writing plays. Even before meeting her, I was drawn to the borscht belt sense of humor she has on the page alongside her profound reservoir of emotion. It’s no accident that the writers and artists whom you have chemistry with in life you have chemistry with on the page, too. Paula used to say reading a play a day makes a playwright: She would meet me for coffee once a week, tell me to write 10 pages and then throw 10 books or plays at me to read.

Putting a female protagonist at the center of a play might sound so simple, but it was rare when Paula started writing [in the 1970s]. But of more consequence to me was her modeling how to be a writer in the world, and how to build a life in the theater over time. She had a way of making young writers feel OK about rejection, like she was inoculating us with resilience.

When she wrote “How I Learned to Drive” (1997) and won the Pulitzer [Prize for Drama], she invited me and two graduate students to Cape Cod — she has this beautiful house overlooking the water. And she said, “I want you to look out over that balcony and say to yourself, ‘This is what playwriting can buy.’” I don’t think any of us ever forgot it.

    "54" : """Juliette Lewis: I first met Sophie in a big office building in Burbank before we shot the pilot [for the TV series “Yellowjackets”]. We were both like, “Oh, it’s you!” She plays a younger version of our character, Natalie, so she studied what I was doing, picking up my heaviness on set. The character is like a loaded weapon — there’s the possibility of danger at any time. Not every actor her age can make you feel that. I had that quality early on — one thing I was recognized for because of “Natural Born Killers” [the 1994 film in which Lewis played a violent fugitive] was that I could scare you. Similarly, Sophie carries herself as a rare bird because she can’t help it.

I was a closeted singer and dancer at her age. When I started making music at 30, it was hard to come back to acting. People were like, “No, you do music now.” And I was like, “But I’m both.” Today you can have an art show, write poetry, make music and then do your TV show. As with any young artist, it’s up to her to get out of her own way and find what she wants to say.

My mistake was believing that I wasn’t worthy, that I didn’t belong here and that I should give up. Any of those themes can manifest in destructive behavior, and you’ll have nothing at the end of that road. It’s important to develop discipline in the form of self-preservation and self-care.Sophie Thatcher: One piece of advice Juliette gave me was, “Finish the thought.” I’ve always suffered from a voice in my head telling me not to complete the song, or that the self-tape is bad. It’s so easy for me to fixate because I’m a perfectionist. I remember there being a change in me after I wrapped my first film, [the 2018 sci-fi movie] “Prospect.” I went home with more self-confidence and saw the power of fully immersing yourself in a world. Everything felt like art to me.

I think it’s important to rid yourself of walls that are created from fear of judgment and anxiety, to go with whatever feels right and do things that are unexpected. Juliette has helped me with that — just watching her and seeing how she never goes for the obvious choice. Some people think the art and music I reference are too dark, but I’m trying not to worry about how others perceive me. There’s a certain expectation for an actor to be a blank slate, but I’m not. I know what I’m into.

    "55" : """Anna Deavere Smith: I have a mentee named Samora Pinderhughes [who’s a musician and multidisciplinary artist], and he does an exercise with my N.Y.U. class where he brings in jazz musicians. A couple of years ago, he came with a tap dancer — it was Michela, and she was fantastic.

Although she’s not traditionally in theater, what she does do — what she’s striving to do — is bring different forms together. She’s not a typical tap dancer; she’s not a typical jazz musician. She’s a real entertainer. I don’t know if people think of me as an entertainer, although I’m using skills that entertainers have. As my friend [the playwright-director] George C. Wolfe once said to me, “Baby, they come to my theater to laugh and yours to cry.”

Mentorship’s not a candy store; it’s a relationship. And Michela just carries with her a spirit that allows her to be approachable: I call it walking hospitality. She’s a dynamic, dynamic woman. Michela’s not a formal mentee [of mine] — I think of her as a sister. Because it goes both ways, right? I learn from her, too.Michela Marino Lerman: I first became aware of Anna when I was in middle school — our teacher wanted us to develop monologues and showed us her plays — and so it’s kind of beyond my comprehension that she’s become an important figure in my life.

What I’ve learned from Anna is this sense of authenticity: listening to everyone’s side of the story — objectively hearing it. It’s akin to what I do as a tap dancer, jazz musician and improvisational artist: Allow things to unfold organically, then sculpt and mold them. But to have somebody outside my wheelhouse see that I can be more than just a tap dancer — that I can reach people beyond what I think I’m capable of — has given me license. What’s profound about her and her work is that she upholds traditions in hope, in compassion, in honesty and truth and in recognizing those qualities in others and amplifying them. She’s not messing around — she really cares.

    "56" : """Wangechi Mutu: I was introduced to Priscilla by Juan Roselione-Valadez, the director of the Rubell Museum in Miami and a former classmate of mine at Cooper Union — friends and old teachers often get in touch when there’s someone interesting who wants to meet me. A few years later, I had a show in Miami, where Priscilla’s from, and we met up and walked around the botanical garden in Coral Gables. It has all these incredible plants from equatorial places including Kenya. Growing up in Nairobi, I developed a real sense of how nature thrives and survives around us, and my work is in part about looking for nature’s healing qualities, which can teach us things in a language all their own. That’s something I felt Priscilla understood. We’re coming out of the same river, in a way.

She’ll send me images of work in progress or of things she’s curious about, and she came to help with the install of my current museum show [“Intertwined,” through June 4] at the New Museum in New York. Her own work is always colorful, mystical and unusual in a beautiful way. I just encourage her to keep going. I think art is a tool that allows people to process what humanity is going through. To me it’s very much an old medicine — looking at all the work for my show makes me hopeful because I know it’ll be here beyond my lifetime and will speak on my behalf.

Priscilla Aleman: I went to an arts magnet high school, and one day in sculpture class, I overheard the teacher talking about Wangechi’s work to another student. When I saw images of her collages, I felt as though I’d walked through a portal. It was a whole new way of seeing a figure.

The first time I met Wangechi, I was nervous, but then she invited me to sit on her back porch in Brooklyn with her and just watch the butterflies. Even after I became her studio assistant in 2010, I was struck by how she cultivated not just her art but a sense of balance and well-being. She’s an awesome mom and grows plants in her studio, and there’s Häagen-Dazs in the fridge. That all taught me that you don’t have to be this struggling artist, bitter and hacking away.

After I got my B.F.A. [from Cooper Union in New York], I felt wrung dry. I wanted to fall in love with creating again, and I turned to archaeology, working in archives and on excavation sites in Miami. There’s something freeing about going into the field and allowing yourself to be led. I felt, too, that the artifacts connected me to the human while highlighting the absence of the body, and that’s how I made my way back to sculpture. Right now, I feel a deep kinship with the ocean. It’s funny how my investigations sometimes parallel Wangechi’s. I’ll say, “Oh, you’re working with mermaids? Me, too.”

    "57" : """Denyce Graves: I hear wonderful voices all the time, but that does not a career make. Ego’s absolutely necessary. When you’re standing up in front of thousands of people, you have to believe that what you have to offer is unique.

As an African American woman who’s made a name for herself in an industry that traditionally excluded us — although it’s changing now — I say to my students: “We’re going to focus on being great. If you’re great, you make it impossible for anyone to say no.”

I first met Symone during her graduate studies at the Peabody Institute at Johns Hopkins [in Baltimore]. She was working at Starbucks, and she’d have to be there at 4 in the morning. She’d sometimes come to the conservatory before her lesson. There are two couches in my studio, and she’d lie down and listen during other people’s lessons.

Work with the voice is intensely personal. It’s not like studying the piano. You are the instrument. If there’s something wrong with the piano, you can get a new one. But you cannot get a new you.

Symone Harcum: During one lesson at Peabody, I thought I was doing really, really great. And then Denyce said, “Your voice is beautiful. But it’s not enough.” I was like, “What is she talking about?” She’s extra dramatic.

What I’ve taken from Denyce is this: We are always singers. What I eat and drink, when and how long I sleep, how I speak while socializing — it all affects my vocal health. This career takes constant dedication.

We audition a lot, especially as young artists. Denyce says to go in as if you’re “presenting them with a gift.” A lot of times, rejection might not have anything to do with you. All you can control is what you bring into that room.

    "58" : """Madhur Jaffrey: I learned about Michelle through my granddaughter. I read her book [“Crying in H Mart,” 2021] and listened to her music, and I thought she seemed like me. Our relationships to our mothers are in many ways similar — when she said in her book that her mother used to watch QVC and buy face creams, I thought of my own mother, who would have my sisters and me rub the cow’s milk from our own cows into our faces because she heard that Cleopatra bathed in the milk of an ass for her milky complexion. Our fathers were similar, too: Michelle’s father never took her music seriously, which reminded me of my father, who told the president of India that acting was just my hobby.

I’ve always thought of myself as an actress and nothing else. I feel sometimes that I’m acting the part of a cook. When I was younger, I didn’t want to be like major Hollywood actors — I wanted to be like those Actors Studio ones. Marlon Brando was fabulous to me. That was always my goal. The honesty of certain performers inspired me: It’s very rare, and you can see it in people’s eyes. Their whole body is moving as one because they’re following one true line of thought.

That’s why I was drawn to Michelle. I see a wonderful young woman on her way. It’s not going to be easy but, whether people think it’s right for her to be writing or singing or not, she’s doing what she thinks is right for her.

Even though Michelle and I had never met before the photo shoot, we fell toward each other quite instinctively. We talked about her husband, and works that I’d done, films of mine she should see and books that she should read. I told her to watch “Shakespeare Wallah” (1965), the Merchant Ivory film. She sent me a one-word text later with a still of me from the film. It said, “star.”

Michelle Zauner: Madhur has a brief appearance in “Vanya on 42nd Street” (1994), which is weirdly a movie that I fell in love with over the pandemic. What I’ve noticed is that we’re both people who are interested in different types of creative media and pursue them with genuine interest and sincerity. Through the years, she’s acted and done a cooking MasterClass and written children’s books, cookbooks and a memoir. She’s someone who has continually just done what she’s wanted to do, even if it’s not a straight career path.

It’s comforting — as you get older, you have a stronger sense of your fragile shelf life, and to see a woman who’s almost 90 still pursue different sides of herself and do it with such grace is beautiful. Here she was [on set], making jokes, matching her lipstick to her sweater, just being fabulous.

    "59" : """Ruth Rogers: Nina had this impressive C.V. — she’d directed plays at Oxford — which didn’t really qualify her to be a waiter, but of course we took her [in 1999], and with her charm and intelligence, she immediately made the restaurant a better place. At that time, my husband, Richard Rogers [who died in 2021], and I would have charitable events at our house where actors would do one-man shows. Ian McKellen did a night. Judi Dench did a night. Nina wanted to put on a play. She chose “Ashes to Ashes” (1996) by Harold Pinter, and he agreed to come. He rather terrifyingly made it clear that there couldn’t be one extraneous sound in the house while he was there. He wasn’t an easy person, but he was so enamored of Nina.

There are a lot of parallels between what she and I do. Restaurants are full of a controlled sort of drama. Nina picked up on that and later wrote a play set in one [“Service,” 2001]. She’s also collaborative — if I have to write something, she’s the one I call. The first thing we did together was my eulogy for Kirk Varnedoe, the chief curator of painting and sculpture at [New York’s] Museum of Modern Art and my best friend. When our son Bo died a decade later, I wanted to write something, and again she was there for me. We’ve had midnight calls, 3 a.m. calls, spent crossing out paragraphs.

I’ve learned so much from the people I’ve worked with. My husband and I were also very dependent on each other. His architectural practice was steps away from the cafe; he’d call me and say, “Come look at this drawing,” and I’d call him and say, “Come taste this soup.” It’s important to keep friends and loved ones close. I always tell my kids, “Give a big party in a small space.”

Nina Raine: A friend of mine knew an opera singer who worked at the River Cafe and suggested I apply. I think it’s a testament to Ruthie that Jamie Oliver was famous by then but still doing shifts there: I remember him squirting pomodorini tomatoes at everybody like they were water pistols. My friend Kathy Tozer also worked there. She’s an actress and a writer, and we got the idea to do a Pinter two-hander at Ruthie’s.

Ruthie got behind it completely, without knowing whether we’d be any good — she isn’t afraid of risk. I started to get nervous because people like [the directors] Richard Eyre and Peter Hall R.S.V.P.’d yes; they thought they were going to get great canapés at Ruthie Rogers’s house. Being in theater is different than being a novelist because you have to watch people consume your work — Chekhov said it perfectly when, in “The Seagull” (1896), Trigorin thinks all the dark-haired spectators disliked his play and all the fair-haired ones were indifferent. But after our performance, Pinter offered Kathy and me walk-on parts as waitresses in his play “Celebration” (2000).

Ruthie is very wise, especially about relationships, and she’s continually evolving. The first “River Cafe Cookbook” (1995) has these black-and-white photos that I love. I thought, “Why would you ever change that?” But the next one also has color photos. It’s the same with her podcast, which she started during the pandemic — she’s so alive to what’s going on. And of course, her food is divine.

    "60" : """Margaret Cho: If I go back and look at my comedy sets from the ’90s, my voice was all over the place. It was this confusion of, “Who am I supposed to be?” I had a hard time understanding, or committing to, artistic integrity, whereas Atsuko already has the presentation down: She knows who she is. She has a strong sense of self that took me a long time to develop.

To me, humor is the unexpected thought that comes through. Atsuko’s work is observational, but it’s delivered through misdirection. She’s big in the comedy community, in terms of both the way she works and the extent to which she works — the incredible variety of things she’s been able to do, whether it’s on TikTok or Instagram, or having the cast of “Saturday Night Live” accept one of her [social media] challenges.

It’s rare, in comedy, certainly, but in entertainment in general, to find somebody with a unique point of view that blends so seamlessly into what they do as an artist. It’s how she looks at everything — family dynamics, for example, by including her grandmother — or the way she communicates her sensibility as an Asian American: She’s got Taiwanese in there, Japanese and Californian. And that hair. Nobody in the history of comedy has had better hair.

Atsuko Okatsuka: Margaret was the first comedian I’d ever seen do stand-up. I was an immigrant living in a garage with my mom and grandma. Our world was small, and I had a hard time making friends, so if my immediate family members weren’t into something, I probably hadn’t seen it. I was at church, during a sermon, when someone passed me a DVD of Margaret’s [2002 comedy special] “Margaret Cho: Notorious C.H.O.” like it was contraband.

What I think we all saw in Margaret was confidence. I often wonder what it must feel like for her, knowing who she is since she was born. It took me probably 10 years to figure out my voice. I’ve told her, and maybe she should be reminded more often, that not only was she a trailblazer but she keeps evolving — the way she talks about things has changed with the times, too. When I say “trailblazer,” I mean that she made her mark and continues to do so. That last part I haven’t told her.

    "61" : """Danai Gurira: For Dominique to be out there now is thrilling. We’re both children of immigrants and, though our journeys are different [Thorne’s family is from Trinidad; Gurira’s is from Zimbabwe], we have that similarity when your parents come from another place and you’re used to a dual cultural existence. There’s something courageous in her; she’s not going to walk into a space unprepared. She’s wise for her years and grounded. There was a tender day on set [for “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,” filmed after Chadwick Boseman, the franchise’s original star, died in 2020] when we connected deeply. You never expect grief; it just hits when it wants. We had to lean on each other, and Dominique understood what we were dealing with.

When I was in grad school [for acting, at N.Y.U.], I was distraught about how terribly African women were portrayed in the West, if they ever were. Putting out stories that countered that — whether through acting in my first play [“In the Continuum,” 2005, co-written with Nikkole Salter] or watching others in my subsequent plays [including “Eclipsed” on Broadway in 2016] — felt like what I was meant to do. The joy for me is to see Black women from around the world getting our stories told: Letitia [Wright, another “Black Panther” actor] is Guyanese British, and she had to learn a ton of Shona when she was the lead in my play at the Young Vic [“The Convert,” 2018-19, in London]. To have her doing our accents and intonations beautifully was like seeing the diaspora embracing itself.

Dominique Thorne: The first time I met Danai was for rehearsals. There seemed to be an inside joke between [Wright and the director Ryan Coogler] that they were ready for Danai whenever she was, the expectation being that she came with comments, questions and critiques about the character [Okoye, a warrior], about the language, about the scene. They were correct: Her whole script was covered with annotations. I remember thinking, “That’s what an actor’s job is.”

With actors like Danai and [their “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” co-star] Angela Bassett, now you can see a Black woman being a superhero or a warrior — a Black woman being absolutely anything. It’s almost a requirement of the work I’m doing, to honor and learn from what was done before me: That’s the blueprint. My being able to play a superhero is just the new floor.

    "62" : """Marina Abramović: Last year, a friend who I was working with on my opera project “7 Deaths of Maria Callas” in Naples told me, “You have to come to Majorca and hear the voice that is closest to Callas’s.” There was no way I wasn’t going. Sondra was singing [at the Cap Rocat hotel], and the performance broke my heart. Afterward, I was invited for dinner, and we talked about our painful backgrounds. Everything was happening — the death of her mother at the same time as her divorce. I felt like my younger sister had just come out of the cosmos.

Our work is very emotional. My public cries, her public cries. We all cry. It comes from the deep honesty of the work. We’re not acting or pretending. We believe what we’re showing. Sondra’s Medea [at the Metropolitan Opera in New York in 2022] blew my mind. She crawled, she had blue legs from the injuries, her makeup was running — she didn’t care.

Sondra doesn’t have children, and I never wanted to have them. So many women start as the great artist and then, as mothers, they can’t continue with the same intensity. Right now, if you told me to go to New Zealand, I’d be ready in 10 minutes. I don’t have any commitments that keep me away from what I want to do. I’m 76, and I have work booked until 2028. I have no time to think about dying. I work and then, when my body gives up, it gives up. Picasso made hundreds of erotic artworks in the years before he died. That’s the life force that artists should have.

Sondra Radvanovsky: I’ve finally gotten to the point where I don’t care if you think I’m fat or ugly, a good or bad singer, a good or bad person. That’s what I’ve learned from Marina. She’s given me the strength to be vulnerable and to take risks. Before “Medea,” I’d never been willing to go that close to the fire, so to speak. It’s thrilling, but it can be dangerous. Imagine singing a very vocally difficult opera while crying. After watching Marina, I decided to try it.

We’re both strong women, and there’s a word that’s usually used to describe strong women — [the word for] a female dog. I can’t imagine growing up with Marina’s strength in her generation. She didn’t just step out of her box, she screamed from the rooftops, and I think about the hate mail she must have received, the nastiness and the words used to describe her.

There’s also a spiritual side to us both. One day, we were sitting in Marina’s apartment in New York when a dove landed on the railing of her balcony. I always equate a dove with my father visiting me. She said, “In all the years that I’ve lived in this apartment, a dove has never landed there. It’s fate, destiny, whatever you want to call it.” I said, “That’s why we’re kindred spirits: We both believe in something bigger than us. It’s where our art comes from.” We sat there for a few moments, looking at the bird.

    "63" : """Joy Harjo: I’ve been lucky to have always had an audience, but only recently have I gotten recognition. You have to survive by trusting yourself. I remember feeling stunned by that phone call [saying she’d been named U.S. poet laureate in 2019].

When you get to my age, you realize that you wouldn’t be where you were unless you had certain cultural knowledge passed on to you. [My cultural mentors were] relatives like my aunt Lois Harjo and the poets Audre Lorde and N. Scott Momaday.

There is a generation of gifted young Native poets who have made quite a potent impression, including Natalie Diaz [Mojave and an enrolled member of the Gila River Indian community], Sherwin Bitsui [a member of the Navajo Nation] and Layli Long Soldier. Layli and I are similar in that she’s musical; I’m a horn player, and she plays guitar. Most of the first conversations I had with her were about that, not about poetry. Everyone has to find their own way to writing poetry. Layli’s work is groundbreaking in how lyrically and bravely she engages with history.

Layli Long Soldier: Joy spoke to one of our poetry classes at the Institute of American Indian Arts [in Santa Fe, N.M.], and I introduced myself afterward.

At the time, I had a band; people referred to it as post-rock. I don’t know if that was really what it was. I chose creative writing as a kind of second-best choice, like, “OK, I’ll try this.” But now, as a writer, I’m able to use elements of sounds, composition and notation in work, as well as aspects of rhythm and timing.

Joy has such a deep respect for our Native community. She always returns to that — to our philosophies, our beliefs, our ways of doing things. And I have, too: I’ve always looked backward to my literary kin to see what’s been done before me.

    "64" : """Marlee Matlin: I hadn’t heard of Teyana before watching “A Thousand and One” (2023), a film in which she plays a mother who kidnaps her son from the foster care system. My kids knew her as a singer; although I don’t experience music the same way hearing people do, I find it fascinating that you can use lyrics to express emotion and tell a story. As an actor, I do that with a script — that’s my music.

Watching Teyana’s movie as a juror at this year’s Sundance Film Festival, I identified with her because I saw fearlessness and rawness in her performance that reminded me of what I did in my first film [the 1986 drama “Children of a Lesser God,” for which Matlin won an Oscar]. As I get older, I’m even more confident as an actress and as a person. Even though I’m Deaf, I make noise.

Teyana Taylor: If I hadn’t broken out of music, Marlee wouldn’t know me from a can of paint. I signed my first record deal at 15. Coming up in the industry, everyone wants you to focus on just one thing, but I’ve never been OK with that.

I’m a New York girl, and we know how to stay hungry. The greatest advice I’ve received is to never take things personally. Once I understood the power in those words, I was able to pass that message along. I had to grow up quickly, but I don’t think I fully experienced adulthood until I had kids and got married. That’s when I started to really find my voice. My art went from being fun to “Listen up: I’ve got something to say.”

    "65" : """Sharon D Clarke: Lexi and I met in 1999. We were in a “Cinderella” pantomime at Hackney Empire in London. She was in the chorus, and I noticed her the minute she opened her mouth. She’s this funky mezzo-soprano, and she’s little, but she’s what we Jamaicans call talawa — she’s powerful. That was her professional stage debut, and it was also during that show that my wife, Susie McKenna, who was directing, and I fell in love. Since then, I’ve done more jobs with Lexi and watched her have this phenomenal career. She’s one of those performers who genuinely moves me, and her being the first [full-time] Black Elphaba in “Wicked” [in 2008] was such an achievement. She’s also just a solid, gorgeous, glowing human being — and a wonderful baker.

You have to stay in touch with why you’re doing what you’re doing. That’s what got me through the harder times when I was sitting in a house I shared with my sister, not working and surrounded by papers for loans. Around 30, my career took a turn and I started getting more auditions. Now I can say, “My God. Within one year, I’ve done a play and a musical on Broadway.” I feel blessed, and proud to tell stories from a different viewpoint that get people thinking. That’s my way of being political.

For [the 2019 West End production of] “Death of a Salesman,” our directors gave us scripts with the stage directions taken out. Usually, there are instructions in there [regarding tone], like, “Linda tentatively. …” She’s often seen as a doormat, but she isn’t really written that way. She knows her men, their strengths and their faults. She knows herself, and she knows the situation that she’s in. When I played her, I played her in honor of my mom and all strong Black matriarchal women.

Alexia Khadime: Sharon was playing the fairy godmother and, to send Cinderella off to the ball, she sang “Flying Without Wings” by Westlife. Her rendition blew everyone out of the water. With each job I’ve gotten since, she and Susie have been there cheering me on.

The pandemic was tough on the arts, but there was something about it — probably not always running to the next audition — that made a penny drop in my head. I moved away from always wanting to please, which has allowed me to play with different ideas. The beauty of theater is that it doesn’t have to be the exact same show every night.

I recently reprised my role as Elphaba. To be honest, I never thought I’d play her in the first place. It’s another reminder that representation matters. Like those clips of little girls seeing the “Little Mermaid” trailer [for the upcoming film with the actress-singer Halle Bailey playing the role of Ariel] and saying, “She looks like me.” In the future, I’d like to do more TV and voice-over work. Sometimes people think you do musical theater and it stops there. Well, no. I want to do it all.

    "66" : """Wu Tsang: My first encounters with Klein’s work were with her music. It’s a sound that grounds you in a moment, insisting upon poetic forms to talk about experience that’s personal and political, social and shared. I love the way she mixes video, live performance, music and poetry. She has this brilliant way of calling together vast materials and atmospheres. I also try to do that in my own way.

I often get to know new friends through working on things together, and in 2018, I invited Klein to come to Troy, N.Y., with me and some of the members of the collective I work with, Moved by the Motion. It was for a residency we had with the Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center to develop our first stage production, “Sudden Rise” (2018) [which uses an exquisite corpse of words, film images, movements and sounds to create a form of phantasmagoria]. One thing all the members of Moved by the Motion have in common is that we’re excited about the possibilities of storytelling — we tell stories by layering visuals, soundscapes and poetry.

Another collaborator of mine, the writer Fred Moten, talks about the idea of the band — groups of people getting together to improvise or play — and I think that’s how I relate to artistic legacy, which is recognizing that I’m part of an ongoing collective project. I always tell younger artists that the most important thing is to find people you want to be in conversation with. Having friends or a community is what will sustain you making art.

Klein: I grew up in a place where the only things I could see as valuable were hot tubs and swimming pools, “MTV Cribs” style. For years, I thought what I was making wasn’t important. During the EMPAC residency, I was doing a mixture of prepared piano and field recording, and Wu and Tosh [Tsang’s creative partner, the visual and performance artist Tosh Basco] were so encouraging. It was helpful to meet someone who also was working across different media. It showed me that you can do whatever you want, whether it’s comedy, sound or even magic.

With “Star in the Hood,” my most recent sound project, I wanted to make a record that addressed how I felt about my family, my friends and where I’m from. I was trying to communicate without necessarily using my voice by making it drone or looping catchphrases over and over again. People have these self-inflicted rules about how things must be — like a musical instrument being tuned in a certain way.

Whenever I see artists being true to who they are, whether it gets a million views or one view, that gasses me. That’s what I love about Soulja Boy, about Shystie, about Wu. I want there to be more people like her who are making the art that they want to see. Our throwaways, the things that we thought weren’t important but were personal to us, do mean something. They can have an effect on someone’s life.

    "67" : """Six years ago, the Cornley Polytechnic Drama Society brought its production of “The Murder at Haversham Manor” from its home base in England to Broadway. Mayhem ensued. Part of the manor collapsed. An actor was poisoned in a prop mix-up. After the leading lady was knocked unconscious by a door, she was replaced by the stage manager; when knocked unconscious as well, he was replaced by a sound technician and eventually, somehow, a grandfather clock.

The company has grown up since then, or down, or perhaps just sideways. Rebranded as the Cornley Youth Theater, and for reasons of liability or just sheer embarrassment no longer associated with a polytechnic institute, it has returned to Broadway with its children’s version of J.M. Barrie’s “Peter Pan.” Many of the same disasters happen chez Darling as happened at Haversham Manor, or close variations on them. Let’s just say that Peter doesn’t fly so much as flail while airborne. He, too, is knocked unconscious.

And so may you be, with laughter, especially if you did not see the earlier show, which despite its disguise of amateurism was a highly polished production called “The Play That Goes Wrong.” For the Cornley players (like the Cornley Theater) are of course fictitious, part of a tradition of farcical comedies featuring terrible actors that goes back at least to “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” In “Peter Pan Goes Wrong,” which opened Wednesday at the Ethel Barrymore Theater, with a game Neil Patrick Harris in a guest role, the jokes and mishaps are still funny, if not quite as magical the second time around.

For one thing, if you are already familiar with the Cornley modus maloperandi, you will spot some of the setups the moment you take your seat. That’s assuming the panicked performers, bickering in the auditorium preshow, let you sit.

Onstage, the Darlings’ nursery looks as if it were built on a budget not greater than the cost of a ticket, with a rickety three-level bunk bed, a wobbly casement window and wiring that’s already sparking before the lights go down. The “flying operator” credit in the Cornley program inspires little confidence: “Not yet known.” And the turntable that will deliver the children to Neverland looks just as likely to deliver them to the emergency room.

Perhaps 500 things go wrong in “Peter Pan Goes Wrong,” some of them nearly fulfilling Peter’s prediction in the Barrie play: “To die will be an awfully big adventure.” Peter spends much of the play upside down or in bandages. Nana, the Darlings’ Newfoundland-slash-nursemaid, gets trapped trying to squeeze through a dog door, and has to be chainsawed out. Nor is this the first time the actor playing Nana has faced an onstage disaster. In the Cornley production of “Oliver!” some years ago, he squashed the title character.

That Nana is haunted by the memory — and that each of the other actors has a pathetic trait as well — helps give texture to the relentless shenanigans. Still, as the formula seems to require, the “Goes Wrong” shows often get near and sometimes cross the line at which violence and mockery cease to be funny. That line moves over time, of course; if stuttering no longer seems amusing, it was a surefire laugh-getter not long ago.

And though it’s always hilarious to see floorboards fly up and smack actors in the face, the professionalization of fake trauma may have outstripped the comedy of it. The difficulty of producing a stunt safely is not, after all, related to the amusement it provides; in fact, the difficulty, when too obvious, can get in the way. “Peter Pan Goes Wrong,” directed by Adam Meggido, too often belabors the horseplay, making it feel mechanical.

Milder but more endearing are the jokes that depend on miscues, amateur acting and erratic stagecraft. The chair that is meant to deliver the narrator (Harris) to and from the stage sometimes jerks him too suddenly into position and other times makes an excruciatingly slow exit. Harris, who will appear at most performances through April 30, is expert at consternation that turns into helplessness.

And Dennis, the young Cornley actor playing John Darling and Mr. Smee, “who doesn’t know a single line,” must have his words provided through headphones; he repeats them verbatim, even when they’re clearly not meant to be spoken. “Dennis, you’re wearing the wrong costume,” he declaims proudly. “No, don’t say that, that is obviously not a line.”

In such moments, “Peter Pan Goes Wrong” begins to achieve the dizzying liftoff of the best backstage farces, like Michael Frayn’s “Noises Off.” In the confusing atmosphere where real life, the play and the play within the play meet, you feel unmoored from the customary gravity of the theater. Words make very little sense, especially when, as happens blissfully once or twice, the dialogue slips out of alignment and one actor jumps ahead while another stays behind. (That also happened in “The Play That Goes Wrong.”) And when Mrs. Darling and her maid are declared to be “different in every way” though they are quite obviously played by the same flustered actor, disbelief is more than suspended. Wonderfully, it’s shattered.

Alas, the reprieve from the weight of meaning is only temporary. Too often, the belaboring rebounds and you crash back to earth as ungracefully as Peter Pan. Several bits depend on a setup too outlandish even for farce, which works best when the conditions are real but the responses extreme, instead of the other way around. When sound cues are somehow switched with recordings of offstage conversations and even audition tapes, it’s too far-fetched to amuse.

Still, the cast makes even the dimmest jokes shine; you admire the polish. The play’s three authors, once drama school chums, have given themselves the best roles. Henry Shields, the choleric, John Cleese-like one, plays Mr. Darling and Captain Hook; Henry Lewis, the haunted teddy bear, is naturally Nana; and Jonathan Sayer is the headphoned idiot who barely belongs on a stage.

They have all by now honed their shticks into weapons. “Peter Pan Goes Wrong” has been playing off and on since 2013, and the “Goes Wrong” brand has been incorporated as Mischief Worldwide. Perhaps that growth has now begun to drain some joy from the franchise, which is built not just on endangering amateurs but on loving them and even to some extent being them. Death may be a big adventure, but for bumblers, which is to say all of us, unvarnished life is adventure enough.

    "68" : """Todd Haimes, who rescued New York’s Roundabout Theater Company from bankruptcy and built it into one of the largest nonprofit theaters in America, died on Wednesday in Manhattan. He was 66.

A spokesman, Matt Polk, said his death, at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, was caused by complications of osteosarcoma. Mr. Haimes had lived with the cancer since 2002, when he was diagnosed with sarcoma of the jaw.

As the artistic director and chief executive at Roundabout, Mr. Haimes had an extraordinarily long and effective tenure. He led the nonprofit company for four decades, turning it into a major player on Broadway, where it now runs three of the 41 theaters.

Roundabout has focused on classics and revivals but has also been a supporter of new work. Under Mr. Haimes’s leadership, it excelled on both fronts, winning 11 Tony Awards for plays and musicals it produced and nurturing the careers of contemporary American writers, including Stephen Karam, Joshua Harmon and Selina Fillinger.

Among Roundabout’s biggest successes during his tenure was a 1998 revival of “Cabaret,” originally starring Alan Cumming and Natasha Richardson, that survived a bumpy start (a construction accident interrupted performances for four weeks) and then ran for nearly six years. It returned a decade later for a one-year reprise.

There were many other triumphs, including a 2020 revival of “A Soldier’s Play” that is now touring the country. Both productions won Tony Awards.

We investigate, research and ask around before settling on our subjects. If you know of someone who might be a candidate for a Times obituary, please suggest it here.

Learn more about our process.
Catalyzed by America’s social unrest over racial inequality in 2020, Mr. Haimes led Roundabout in an effort to unearth lost gems written by artists of color. One result was an acclaimed Broadway production of the Black playwright Alice Childress’s 1955 backstage drama, “Trouble in Mind.” It had never made it to Broadway because Ms. Childress had refused to soften the show’s ending to make it less challenging for white theatergoers.

Mr. Haimes joined Roundabout in 1983 as managing director. He was just 26, and the company, founded in 1965 and saddled with debt, was operating in rented space in Manhattan’s Chelsea neighborhood. At one particularly desperate point he used his own credit card to keep the company afloat. But a few weeks after he arrived, the board of directors voted to shut it down.

A board member subsequently donated enough money to buy the company some time, and Mr. Haimes engineered a turnabout — cutting the staff, reducing expenses, improving marketing and, over time, expanding the audience with measures such as early weekday curtain times to attract an after-work crowd, special events for singles and gay theatergoers, and discounts for children. In 2016, he became the first presenter to allow the livestreaming of a performance of a Broadway show, a much-praised revival of “She Loves Me.”

Bernard Todd Haimes was born on May 7, 1956, in Manhattan to Herman and Helaine Haimes. His father was a lawyer, his mother a homemaker.

His onstage life was exceedingly brief: In elementary school on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, he wore a dress to play the title role in a production of “Mary Poppins.” He later claimed that he had landed the part because he was the only child who could pronounce “supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.”

He earned a bachelor’s degree at the University of Pennsylvania and an M.B.A. at Yale. Before arriving at Roundabout, he was general manager of the Hartman Theater Company in Stamford and managing director of the Westport Country Playhouse, both in Connecticut.

“I had no desire to trade stocks and bonds, and making Nivea cream wouldn’t turn me on,” he told The New York Times in 1986. “I’ve loved the theater all my life. I have no desire to be onstage, but I get a tingle just being around one, ever since I worked on the stage crew for ‘How to Succeed in Business’ on Broadway when I was in 10th grade.”

He became producing director of Roundabout in 1989 and added the title of chief executive in 2015.

“The advantage of my background is that all of my artistic decisions are being informed by management concerns,” Mr. Haimes said in 2004. “No one’s ever going to accuse me of being a crazy artist. The disadvantage is the same: that perhaps there are brilliant things other people could accomplish that I just can’t.”

He is survived by his wife, Jeanne-Marie (Christman) Haimes; two children, Dr. Hilary Haimes and Andrew Haimes; two stepdaughters, Julia and Kiki Baron; and four grandchildren. His first two marriages, to Dr. Alison Haimes and Tamar Climan, ended in divorce.

Mr. Haimes led Roundabout’s move to Broadway in 1991, when he began presenting work in the Criterion Center, which no longer exists. The move was a turning point for the company. “Because of the Tony Award eligibility,” he said, “we will have a tremendous advantage when it comes to obtaining the rights to plays, securing directors and attracting distinguished actors.”

In 2000, he moved the company into the renamed American Airlines Theater, which is now Roundabout’s flagship house. It has since also acquired the theater at Studio 54 and assumed operations of the theater now known as the Stephen Sondheim.

Among the Tony-winning shows produced by Roundabout during Mr. Haimes’s tenure were revivals of the plays “Anna Christie” and “A View From the Bridge” and of the musicals “Nine,” “Assassins,” “The Pajama Game” and “Anything Goes.” Roundabout was also among the producers of Tony-winning productions of two new plays, “Side Man” and “The Humans.”

The company now runs five theaters, all in Midtown Manhattan, including the three Broadway houses, an Off Broadway theater and an Off Off Broadway black-box space that it developed to give a platform to emerging playwrights.

Over the years there have also been flops and budget deficits, and some critics have suggested that Roundabout was overextended. Its enormous real estate footprint became a financial challenge that the company addressed partly by renting out some of its Broadway venues to commercial producers. The company made a significant amount of money, for example, by renting out the Sondheim for five years to the producers of “Beautiful,” the Carole King biomusical.

Mr. Haimes was one of a handful of leaders of nonprofit theater companies in New York whose decades-long tenures have raised eyebrows among those who want more turnover. He held onto the Roundabout job even when he took another one, as artistic director of the deeply troubled Toronto theater company Livent, in 1998; that company collapsed, and Mr. Haimes stayed at Roundabout.

Roundabout’s size — 150 employees and a $50 million annual budget — has given it the ability to support significant endeavors offstage. It operates education and training programs, including school partnerships that serve more than 4,000 students each year and a partnership with the stagehands union to train theater technicians.

But like many nonprofits, it has not yet fully rebounded from the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Roundabout staged one show on Broadway this season, a revival of “1776.”

Mr. Haimes, who was often content to remain in the background, was a well-liked and enthusiastic figure in the industry. He was active in both the Broadway and the Off Broadway communities, serving on numerous committees, and over the years he taught at Yale and Brooklyn College.

But he remained a businessman and a booster at heart.

“Basically I’m incredibly insecure and don’t take myself seriously as an artist,” he said in a 1998 interview. “But somehow my taste seems to match up with what the public wants.”

    "69" : """Frank Ocean will not perform at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival this weekend because of a leg injury, a representative for the singer-songwriter said Wednesday, noting that the injury had prevented his performance there last Sunday from going on as planned.

Ocean’s much-anticipated set on Sunday for the festival’s opening weekend was his first large-scale concert in years, but the set drew mixed reviews, with some calling out its tardiness and technical bumps. Later on, reports emerged that the set had been abruptly reconfigured ahead of the nighttime performance.

The statement from Ocean’s representative, Anna Meacham, said that he had suffered a leg injury on the festival grounds days before his first scheduled performance, leading to the preshow scramble.

“Frank Ocean was unable to perform the intended show but was still intent on performing, and in 72 hours, the show was reworked out of necessity,” the statement said. “On doctor’s advice, Frank Ocean is not able to perform weekend 2 due to two fractures and a sprain in his left leg.”

Representatives for Coachella did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the cancellation. The festival’s other headliners are scheduled to repeat from the first weekend — Bad Bunny on Friday and the K-pop group Blackpink on Saturday — with other performers throughout the weekend including Björk, Blink-182, Burna Boy, Gorillaz, Rosalía and many more.

Coachella has dealt with major last-minute cancellations before. Last year, Kanye West (now known as Ye) pulled out as one of the event’s three headliners amid personal upheaval and was replaced by the D.J. group Swedish House Mafia with the Weeknd as a special guest, a performance that was already on the bill.

Sunday’s performance had been years in the making, after the plan for Ocean to headline Coachella in 2020 was scuttled by the pandemic. This year’s festival was viewed as the singer’s re-emergence, but there were early signs that it was not going according to plan.

Most of the festival was livestreamed on YouTube throughout the weekend, and fans were anxiously awaiting the same for Ocean’s set, but late on Sunday, YouTube announced that it would not be part of the livestream. Ocean took the stage about an hour late, then ended abruptly, saying, “I’m being told it’s curfew.”

Some fans and critics complained that the singer was hard to see throughout the set — which included hits like “Bad Religion” and “White Ferrari” — and that there were pauses throughout. (Justin Bieber disagreed with the naysayers, writing on Instagram that he was “blown away” by Ocean’s performance and that “his artistry is simply unmatched.”)

The original plan for the performance was likely much more intricate than what Coachella attendees witnessed. Two hockey players, Dan and Chris Powers, said in a podcast released Tuesday that they had rehearsed for about a month with other ice skaters before they were suddenly cut from the show the day of.

In a statement on Wednesday, Ocean said of his set: “It was chaotic. There is some beauty in chaos. It isn’t what I intended to show but I did enjoy being out there and I’ll see you soon.”

    "70" : """Moonbin, a member of the K-pop band ASTRO, died on Wednesday at his home in Seoul. He was 25.

The pop star’s death was confirmed by the band and its management agency in a statement in Korean posted to Twitter. They did not specify a cause.

“On April 19, ASTRO member Moonbin suddenly left us and has now become a star in the sky,” the agency said. It called on fans to refrain from “speculative and malicious reports” so that his family could process the news. To respect their wishes, the agency added, the funeral would be held as privately as possible, with only family, friends and colleagues.

According to the Korean news agency Yonhap, Moonbin was found dead at his home in the upscale neighborhood of Gangnam at about 8:10 p.m. on Wednesday by his manager, who contacted the Seoul Gangnam Police Station.

Moonbin, born Jan. 26, 1998, was an actor, dancer and model as well as a singer, who also performed as part of the band Moonbin & Sanha. ASTRO, originally a six-person male K-Pop group, shot to fame in 2016 with their debut EP “Spring Up.” They were named to Billboard’s top 10 list of new K-Pop groups that year.

In a statement shared early Wednesday, ASTRO announced the cancellation of the Moonbin & Sanha tour in Jakarta “due to unforeseen circumstances.”

News of Moonbin’s death reverberated throughout the K-pop world, as fans praised the star for introducing them to the genre, and mourned the sudden loss. Social media users in countries around the world posted tributes to him.

In South Korea, several K-pop groups said on Thursday that they would cancel or postpone upcoming events. One was Billlie, a girl group whose seven members include Moon Sua, Moonbin’s younger sister.

Moonbin is the most recent of a series of Korean celebrities in their 20s to have died suddenly. In 2019, the deaths of two other K-pop stars left South Korea soul-searching over what had gone wrong in one of its most popular cultural exports. Earlier this month, Jung Chae-yull, a 26-year-old South Korean actress, was also found dead in her home. Some, though not all, of the cases have been acknowledged as suicide.

    "71" : """Otis Redding III, the son and namesake of the celebrated 1960s soul singer, who made a name for himself as a singer and guitarist, died on Tuesday in Macon, Ga. He was 59.

The cause was cancer, his sister, Karla Redding-Andrews, said in a statement posted on the Facebook page of the Otis Redding Foundation, the family’s charity.

Mr. Redding was just 3 years old when his father died, along with several members of his band, in a plane crash on Dec. 10, 1967, outside Madison, Wis. Otis Redding III and his brother, Dexter, along with a cousin, Mark Lockett, went on to form the funk band the Reddings, which recorded six albums in the 1980s. Otis was a guitarist with the group; Dexter, who survives him, played bass and handled the vocals; and Mr. Lockett played keyboards.

The band had some success on the Billboard charts: “Remote Control” reached No. 6 on the Hot Soul Singles chart and No. 89 on the Hot 100 in 1980. The group's final album, called simply “The Reddings,” which contained the hit single “Call the Law, reached No. 88 on the Billboard album chart in 1988.

The Redding brothers never came close to matching their father’s success, but Otis Redding III nonetheless continued performing. When the soul singer Eddie Floyd hired him as guitarist for a European tour, Mr. Redding became comfortable singing “(Sittin’ on) the Dock of the Bay” and other songs made famous by his father, he told WCSH-TV in Portland, Maine, in 2018.

“He said, ‘You can play guitar with me, but you’re going to have to sing a few of your dad’s songs,’” Mr. Redding recalled Mr. Floyd saying. “I was like, ‘Huh? I don’t sing,’ you know. And he was like, ‘Well, you’re going to sing “Dock of the Bay” with me tonight.’” He continued to perform his father’s songs live.

He said he was grateful for his father’s enduring legacy even if it overshadowed his own music-making efforts.

“I go ahead and do what people want, and I live with it,” he said, adding, “I don’t put myself mentally under any pressure to go begging for record deals.”

Otis Redding III was born on Dec. 17, 1963, in Macon. His mother was Zelma Atwood.

In later years he worked with his family’s foundation to organize summer camps that teach children to play music. He also served as board president of the local chapter of Meals on Wheels.

What’s the Best Thing I Can Do for the Planet?

In addition to his sister Ms. Redding-Andrews and his brother, Mr. Redding’s survivors include another sister, Demetria Redding.

    "72" : """For Drake and the Weeknd, two of the most popular musicians on the planet, the existence of “Heart on My Sleeve,” a track that claimed to use A.I. versions of their voices to create a passable mimicry, may have qualified as a minor nuisance — a short-lived novelty that was easily stamped out by their powerful record company.

But for others in the industry, the song — which became a viral curio on social media, racking up millions of plays across TikTok, Spotify, YouTube and more before it was removed this week — represented something more serious: a harbinger of the headaches that can occur when a new technology crosses over into the mainstream consciousness of creators and consumers before the necessary rules are in place.

“Heart on My Sleeve” was the latest and loudest example of a gray-area genre that has exploded in recent months: homemade tracks that use generative artificial intelligence technology, in part or in full, to conjure familiar sounds that can be passed off as authentic, or at least close enough. It earned instant comparisons to earlier technologies that disrupted the music industry, including the dawn of the synthesizer, the sampler and the file-sharing service Napster.

Yet while A.I. Rihanna singing a Beyoncé song or A.I. Kanye West doing “Hey There Delilah” may seem like a harmless lark, the successful (if brief) arrival of “Heart on My Sleeve” on official streaming services, complete with shrewd online marketing from its anonymous creator, intensified alarms that were already ringing in the music business, where corporations have grown concerned about A.I. models learning from, and then diluting, their copyrighted material.

Universal Music Group, the largest of the major labels and home to both Drake and the Weeknd, had already flagged such content to its streaming partners this month, citing intellectual property concerns. But in a statement this week, the company spoke to the broader stakes, asking “which side of history all stakeholders in the music ecosystem want to be on: the side of artists, fans and human creative expression, or on the side of deep fakes, fraud and denying artists their due compensation.”

Artists and their labels are confident, at least for the time being, that the social and emotional component of fandom will separate the work of the real Drake from a fake one, even if an A.I. version can nod at his emotional preoccupations and musical tics.

But whether superstars could have their pockets picked, or become altogether obsolete in favor of machines that can imitate them, is only one side of the equation. Royalty-free music generators can be used now to compose a rap beat, a commercial jingle or a film score, cutting into an already fragile economy for working musicians.

And as generative A.I. booms and rapidly improves across text, images, sound and video, experts say the technology could reshape creative industries at all levels, with fans, artists and the systems that govern them having to adjust to new norms on the fly.

“It is now possible to produce infinite media in the style or likeness of someone else, soon with little effort, so we all have to come to terms with what that means,” the musician Holly Herndon, who has studied and used A.I. in her work for years, wrote in an email.

“The question is, as a society, do we care what Drake really feels or is it enough to just hear a superficially intelligent rendering?” she asked. “For some people that will not be enough. However, when you consider that most people listening to Spotify are doing so just to have something pleasant to listen to, it complicates things.”

The breakthrough success of “Heart on My Sleeve,” uploaded by a user called ghostwriter, has helped bring music to the forefront of a conversation that has intensified lately around other mediums, especially since the release of Open AI’s ChatGPT language model and image generators like DALL-E. Commenting under the track on YouTube, ghostwriter promised, “This is just the beginning.”

Courts and lawmakers are only beginning to sort out questions of ownership when it comes to A.I., and copyrights in music can be complicated as it is. For now, protected intellectual property can only be created by humans, but what about when musicians collaborate with the machines?


Martin Clancy, a musician and the chair of a global committee that seeks to explore the ethics of A.I. in the arts, said the music industry was more organized than some other fields grappling with the rise of A.I.

“What’s at stake are things we take for granted: listening to music made by humans, people doing that as a livelihood and it being recognized as a special skill,” he said.

It was unclear exactly which elements of “Heart on My Sleeve” — the lyrics, the instrumental beat, the melody, the vocals — were created by A.I. (Ghostwriter declined to comment.)

Some songs have been written by real people and recorded with real human vocals, before being replaced by A.I. imitations of brand-name artists using tools that had “learned” from existing music and produced a similar effect. Those could invite one form of legal challenge: Artists and photographers, for instance, have sued image generators for creating derivative versions of their work.

But a human creator passing off her own song as being performed by a famous artist, or promoting it commercially using that singer’s name or likeness, could lead to a different kind of legal threat. In the past, musicians including Tom Waits and Bette Midler have successfully argued in court that they had a right to not just their musical compositions or recordings, but their voices, in the face of sound-alike imitators in advertisements.

In this case, getting “Heart on My Sleeve” removed from services where it could have earned streaming royalties — and even charted on Billboard — may have been even simpler for Drake, the Weeknd and Universal Music. The track appeared to use a popular vocal snippet from the rapper Future that implied the song was produced by Metro Boomin, a sample of a master recording that was not cleared for use.

Drake, the Weeknd and Metro Boomin declined to comment. (Last week, in response to another track that used an A.I. Drake voice to perform Ice Spice’s “Munch,” Drake wrote cheekily on Instagram, “This is the final straw AI.”)

Aside from raising questions of legality, such technology can introduce knotty ethical concerns regarding race and identity. Last year, Capitol Records apologized and dropped the digital rap avatar FN Meka after critics said the project amounted to a form of blackface. Among the recent explosion of A.I. imitations, rap has emerged as the most common playground.

“It’s another way for people who are not Black to put on the costume of a Black person — to put their hands up Kanye or Drake and make him a puppet — and that is alarming to me,” said Lauren Chanel, a writer on tech and culture. “This is just another example in a long line of people underestimating what it takes to create the type of art that, historically, Black people make.”

But for musicians like Herndon, who has provided her own A.I. voice as a tool for other musicians — complete with a system for compensation — and created a company, Spawning, to build consent guidelines for A.I., there can be magic in harnessing the future fairly and ethically.

“There is more opportunity in exploring this technology than trying to shut it down,” she said.

While meme art like “Heart on My Sleeve” may quickly become “a real cultural force,” she added, “the novelty will eventually be exhausted.” What will remain are the artistic possibilities “when anyone can assume the identity of someone else, even just for a second, as an expressive tool.”

As the technology continues to advance and is adopted in novel ways, someone may eventually do for A.I. voice models — part of what Herndon calls “identity play” — what producers like Prince Paul and J Dilla did for sampling.

“As an artist I am interested in what it means for someone to be me, with my permission, and maybe even be better at being me in different ways,” Herndon said. “The creative possibilities there are fascinating and will change art forever. We just have to figure out the terms and tech.”

    "73" : """The three Danes and a Norwegian who play together as the Danish String Quartet have always had a charming modesty to them. But it was nevertheless a bit of a surprise, when their first studio recording of late Beethoven came out in the initial installment of “Prism,” a series exploring that composer and artistic lineages, to find them writing of themselves as “still a group of boys.”

The Danish, who return to Zankel Hall on Thursday to offer the third part of “Doppelgänger,” their project pairing Schubert with new commissions, have never really approached Beethoven’s formidable last works in their genre like children, after all. They were already renowned as one of the major string quartets by the time they recorded Op. 127 in 2016, when the youngest among them was still 32, and they had built their reputation in large part on their preternatural maturity — a sense of proportion, a slight reserve, a certain inexplicable wisdom — in those scores, which can mystify far more senior musicians.

As they tell it now, though, they had barely gotten going. Op. 127 was the focal point of “Prism I,” the first of five recordings on the ECM label treating the late Beethoven quartets not as the alien, anomalous masterpieces they often appear, but as part of musical history, on the one hand influenced by Bach, who is represented on each release by a transcribed fugue, and on the other influencing later successors, here Mendelssohn, Webern, Bartok, Shostakovich and Schnittke.

“Prism V” came out earlier this month, and it completes a series that has come to mean more to the quartet than they might initially have expected. The eldest of the “boys” has now passed 40: The broad chords they played with such rich allure at the beginning of Op. 127, they write in the note for their most recent release, turned out not only to be “the entry gate to the promised lands of the late Beethoven quartets,” but “the exit door from our life as a young string quartet.”

Op. 127 in E flat, opening
“Prism I” (ECM)
What a prospect a “fully-fledged” Danish String Quartet, as they describe themselves now, will be, for these releases must qualify as some of the most essential listening of the past decade. No recording could quite capture what makes the Danish so special in concert, could make indelible the fleeting aura of rapt, intense concentration that settles in a hall when they are at their best. But the five “Prism” releases come close, documenting the unique potency of a quartet that may not be the most technically imposing around, nor be the most radical in repertoire, but which excels at being itself.

All the elements of the Danish style are here to behold, first among them their particular sound. Part of the intrigue when listening to string quartets comes in hearing how four audibly separate voices convene in music: how they blend together or scrape against one another, or how one rather than the others drives an argument forward. But the Danish play as if they have abandoned their individual personalities entirely to serve the collective — as if they were joined on a single instrument, armed with four bows.

For the three Danes who met as not-yet-teenagers — the violinists Frederik Oland and Rune Tonsgaard Sorensen and the violist Asbjorn Norgaard — and the Norwegian cellist Fredrik Schoyen Sjolin, who joined them in their 20s, music has long been an act of friendship. They share it naturally, as equals. Listen to any of the Bach fugues on the “Prism” releases, and you find that few, if any, of the thematic entries are underlined or even pointed out. Even when they adopt the bare tone they favor in Bach, they adjust their balances to welcome a new line, a new thought, with exquisite, barely perceptible ease.

You get the sense in these recordings that every bar of music has been as carefully considered as it should be, that the minutest aspect of each note has been discussed; the control of sonority and articulation on show is absolute, even as the range of both is vast.

Op. 131 in C-sharp minor, finale
“Prism III” (ECM)
There are downsides to the Danish approach, sensible as a whole yet bold in details. Their patience pays dividends in the long slow movements of Op. 127 and Op. 132, but becomes a tad staid in the drawn-out variations of Op. 131. Theirs is not a Beethoven of struggle, of strife; if they allow rough edges to creep into the blistering dissonance of the Grosse Fuge, they hardly threaten the general air of composure. The most violent playing across the series, oddly, comes in the first movement of Mendelssohn’s A minor quartet on “Prism II,” as a young disciple rages at a master’s death.

For the most part, the Danish impose themselves as indirectly as possible on the music, and they seem happy to let the connections running through the albums strike the listener as they come, too. “Doppelgänger” places Schubert works alongside new pieces explicitly inspired by them — Thursday’s concert pairs Anna Thorvaldsdottir’s “Rituals” with Schubert’s “Rosamunde” — and the links in “Prism” are similar, if less deliberately contrived. They can be a matter of direct quotation, as when Schnittke uses the Grosse Fuge in his Third Quartet, or of something as clear as Bartók beginning his First with a slow canon echoing the methods of Beethoven’s Op. 131. But they can also be elusive; you still have to listen, and listen well.

Op. 130 in B flat, fourth movement
“Prism II” (ECM)
Listening well also reveals the subtle liberties that the Danish bring to their playing, the touches that prevent their performances from ever sounding bland. They find astonishing rhythmic freedom within the confines of their admirable discipline, a lilt to their phrasing that surely stems from the folk songs they so eagerly arrange and perform together. Take, as examples, the sense they make of the awkward opening of the finale of Op. 132, so often ungainly in the hands of others, and the elegant spring they lend to the dancing fourth movement of Op. 130, whose cavatina they unfurl with breathtaking serenity. It’s playing whose virtues speak for themselves, yet its simplicity is anything but.

“The first album was recorded by four relatively fresh young men,” the Danish write in their latest release. “Now we are fathers of babies, toddlers and school kids.” Here is a rare middle age we can welcome.

    "74" : """Ernest Anthony Puente, known as Tito, was born in Harlem on April 20, 1923, and went on to create an enormous body of work (over 100 albums) while earning a reputation as a tireless performer. His irresistible swirl of energy helped make his main instrument, the timbales, emblematic of Latin music in the mid-20th century.

In a career that stretched over six decades, Puente was a clever innovator and a prized collaborator. He got his start playing with Machito and his Afro-Cubans, the band led by Frank (Machito) Grillo that pioneered Afro-Cuban jazz fusion. He then went on to headline, becoming one of the stars of the glitzy Palladium mambo era — named for the club on West 52nd Street in Manhattan that attracted diverse crowds to dance to mambo orchestras with elaborate horn and percussion sections. When stripped-down salsa bands of a new generation began to steal his thunder, he persisted by hiring both La Lupe and Celia Cruz — two brilliant and beloved Cuban singers — as his lead vocalists. In the 1980s, he found new ways to evolve Latin jazz by spotlighting the work of unheralded instrumentalists, and at the end of the century, he teamed with younger singers like La India and Marc Anthony.

Growing up in New York, decades before the “Great Migration” in the 1950s of Puerto Ricans to the United States, Puente was a prototypical Nuyorican. He was just as comfortable speaking in English as in Spanish, and he idolized big-band jazz icons like Benny Goodman and Gene Krupa while studying piano with Victoria Hernández, a sister of the famed Puerto Rican bandleader Rafael Hernández. Like Krupa, Puente moved his percussion kit to the front of the band, a move that centered the rhythm as the driver of the dance beat and came to define the mambo sound — big-band jazz fused with Afro-Cuban rhythms and featuring extended improvisational breaks that fueled dancers’ energy — much in the way Eddie Palmieri and Willie Colón would later feature trombones to define salsa.

When Puente died in June 2000 at 77, it was a great blow not only to fans of mambo, cha-cha-cha, bugalú, salsa and Latin jazz, but also to New York itself. Yet his sound lives on and concerts celebrating his era resonate in the city he called home and beyond. (Jazz at Lincoln Center will present its “Tito Puente and Tito Rodriguez Centennial Celebration” on May 5 and 6 at the Rose Theater.)

Here are 10 examples of how Puente became known as the King of Latin music.


“Abaniquito” (1949)
The song that started Puente’s ascent was released as a 78-r.p.m. single with a hyperactive piano vamp and frenetic rhythm section that showcased the unrestrained dance floor energy of what was then an emergent Palladium scene. Featuring the beloved vocalist Vicentico Valdés as well as Graciela Pérez, Machito’s sister, on the chorus, the track exemplifies the strong influence of the Machito band on Puente’s jazz-mambo fusion.

“Babarabatiri” (1951)
Arriving at the dawn of the mambo era, this song is a riveting immersion in Puente’s rapidly coalescing sound. It’s flush with jazz swing, irresistible syncopation and a call-and-response between a repetitive vocal chorus, the horn section and percussion. Seizing on the momentum created by an earlier version — by the Cuban vocalist Beny Moré fronting Pérez Prado’s orchestra — the Puente rendition, with the vocalist Santos Colón, comes off as a cooler jazz reinterpretation.

“Mamborama” (1955)
By the mid-1950s, Puente had emerged as one of the dominant performers on the Palladium scene, engaged in his famous rivalry with the bandleader and vocalist Tito Rodríguez, who responded to the “Mamborama” album with his 1956 release “Mambo Madness.” Puente’s LP features the loping yet propulsive rhythmic figures of “Ran Kan Kan,” another classic, but the anthemic “Mambo Inn” makes perhaps the album’s strongest statement with its triumphant melodic theme, bruising horn section and the powder-keg pummeling of Puente’s timbale-conga attack.

Tito Puente & His Orchestra, “Top Percussion” (1957)
Taking a short break from Palladium mambo, Puente dug deep into the African roots of Cuban dance music on this album, bringing together the percussionists Mongo Santamaría and Willie Bobo with the vocalist Merceditas Valdés to re-create the feeling of rumba and ritual toque de santo, a practice designed to communicate with the pantheon of Yoruban deities. The album closes with the seven-minute “Night Ritual,” an Afro-Cuban jazz suite featuring Johnny Carson’s bandleader, the trumpeter Doc Severinsen. Puente revisited the concept in 1960 with “Tambó,” which repeated the deep percussion theme while using more mambo orchestra instruments.

“Dance Mania” (1958)
Perhaps Puente’s most famous and most listened to album, “Dance Mania” began the shift from mambo to what would become known as salsa by including some tracks identified by their Cuban-derived genres. While the track list is populated with standard mambos, “Cuando te Vea,” is listed as a guaguancó, a Cuban groove quintessential to the future evolution of the salsa sound, with Santos Colón doing an early take on the soneo, or lead vocal improvisation. The album also includes an early appearance from Ray Barretto, who would become one of salsa’s most renowned congueros and bandleaders.

“Oye Como Va” (1962)
At once tracing the roots and routes of Latin music in the 20th century, the song “Oye Como Va,” while not exactly a Puente masterpiece, tells the story of how Afro-Cuban music found its way into the American mainstream. Its opening riffs are based on the Cuban bassist Israel “Cachao” López’s classic “Chanchullo,” and the track is formally a cha-cha-cha that celebrates dance floor flirting. It was famously covered in 1970 by Santana, and the band’s leader, Carlos Santana, was said to have been convinced to do the song by the rock promoter Bill Graham, who had spent much of his youth in the 1950s dancing to mambo at Puente’s Palladium.

La Lupe and Tito Puente, “Tito Puente Swings/The Exciting Lupe Sings” (1965)
While an argument can be made that “El Rey y Yo (The King and I)” from 1967 is the peak of Puente and La Lupe’s collaboration, their album “Tito Puente Swings/The Exciting Lupe Sings” seems more spontaneous while capturing Puente’s peak cha-cha-cha grooves. It also marks Puente’s attempts to reconcile the end of the Palladium era with the emergence of the Cuban/African American R&B hybrid of bugalú.

Tito Puente and Celia Cruz, “Cuba y Puerto Rico” (1966)
As Puente’s working relationship with La Lupe became more contentious, he began to turn to Celia Cruz, another Cuban vocalist who had made her mark as the lead singer of the legendary Sonora Matancera orchestra. Cruz seized the opportunity to become a solo star in her own right, ultimately becoming la Reina de la Salsa (the Queen of Salsa), largely as a result of her magisterial performances with Puente. “La Guarachera,” from the album “Cuba y Puerto Rico,” became one of her signature tracks.

Tito Puente, India and the Count Basie Orchestra, “Jazzin’” (1996)
Toward the end of his career, Puente became a prominent member of the promoter Ralph Mercado’s stable of salsa and merengue acts that proliferated in New York’s Latin club scene. He became El Rey (the King) for young people who were trying to reconnect with their parents’ music by learning to dance at clubs like the 14th Street Palladium and S.O.B.’s. This era included his team-up with La India, a salsa vocalist who began her career singing house music, on “Jazzin’” (which also featured the Count Basie Orchestra); and a collaboration with Marc Anthony that began on ‌a 1991 album Anthony recorded with the Paradise Garage D.J. Little Louie Vega (“When the Night Is Over”), making Puente’s sound a rediscovered staple of the ’90s downtown Latin scene.

Eddie Palmieri and Tito Puente, “Masterpiece” (2000)
Going back to “Puente Goes Jazz” (1956), an underrecognized tour de force that also features Ray Barretto, and “Herman’s Heat & Puente’s Beat,” a 1958 collaboration with Woody Herman, Puente excelled at making records that strongly connected with his first love: jazz. Beginning with “On Broadway” in 1982, Puente embarked on a nine-album relationship with the jazz label Concord Records, doing covers of John Coltrane’s “Afro Blue,” Dave Brubeck’s “Take Five” and Bud Powell’s “Un Poco Loco,” among an avalanche of original material that redefined Latin jazz as a genre, particularly through the spirit of underrecognized collaborators like the Dominican saxophonist Mario Rivera. His jazz period reached its peak with his 2000 collaboration with Eddie Palmieri, “Masterpiece.”

    "75" : """Debora Cahn most recently served as an executive producer and writer on “Homeland.” Keri Russell most famously played a hyper-efficient assassin on “The Americans.” Their collaboration in the new Netflix series “The Diplomat” — Cahn created it, Russell stars — would lead you to expect something dark, violent and complicated.

But a look further back in Cahn’s history shows that she started her career with a long run as a writer and producer on “The West Wing.” And that’s the spirit she’s brought to “The Diplomat,” a political thriller laced with romance and written, with some success, in an Aaron Sorkinesque high-comic, high-velocity style.

So you would be right about complicated, at least. Geopolitical crises and amorous complications are thick on the ground, intertwining and constantly morphing in ways that can be hard to follow. (The serial twists and breathless explanations both contribute to and help to obscure the plot-greasing implausibilities necessary for a show that puts earthshaking events in a comic framework.)

Russell plays Kate Wyler, a career American diplomat suddenly and surprisingly named ambassador to Britain. She arrives in London with her trailing spouse, Hal (Rufus Sewell), a more experienced and renowned diplomat who is now expected to smile for the cameras but otherwise keep his mouth shut. For them, artifice is an essential element in both statecraft and marriage.

Kate and Hal’s union is on its last legs, as it turns out. But thanks to an improbable, possibly MacGuffinish twist, it is mandatory that they stay together. So one pole of the plot is their highly cultivated Bickersons act, a will-they-or-won’t-they screwball anti-romance between an unforgiving woman and a roguish, egomaniacal man; you may see ghostly images of Carole Lombard and John Barrymore. At the same time, Hal, along with Kate’s fiercely competent deputy, Stuart (Ato Essandoh), is tasked with turning the combative Kate into a more refined diplomat, an arduous process with echoes of “My Fair Lady” and “Kiss Me, Kate.”

The rom-com complications — they also encompass Kate’s attraction to the British foreign minister (David Gyasi) and a classic secondary romance between Stuart and the C.I.A. station chief (Ali Ahn) — and the political machinations bounce off and intensify one another, in the old “West Wing” style. An attack on a British warship in the Middle East starts an eight-episode chain of events involving Iran and Russia that has Kate shuttling between the American president (Michael McKean) and the British prime minister (Rory Kinnear, who stands out in an excellent cast) and, with Hal’s help, salvaging U.S.-U.K. relations while pretty much literally saving the world.

“The Diplomat” is concerned with the dynamics of the international order, the proper balance between idealism and realpolitik, and the fallout of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, but it’s essentially a show about a marriage. The conceit of Kate as the undiplomatic diplomat — a woman whose stone-cold, steel-trap strategic abilities would be considered suitable for the Court of St. James’s — is, to put it kindly, absurd, but its main purpose is to set up the contrast with the smoother, more devious, more obviously diplomatic Hal.

And you can see how Russell’s coldblooded excellence in “The Americans” would recommend her for the part of Kate. (In an amusing nod to Russell’s long run as the murderous Elizabeth Jennings, Kate is asked whether she poisoned a fellow diplomat and deadpans, “Not my style.”) But while she’s perfectly proficient, and has no trouble conveying the character’s intelligence and, when called for, her uncertainty or anger, Russell is not as funny as the show needs her to be. Relaxing into the role and giving the emotional connections the casual, spontaneous feel that the rom-com structure calls for are not her strengths.

Luckily for “The Diplomat,” Sewell has no trouble getting in touch with his inner Barrymore, and he walks away with the show. Hal is petulant, childish and arrogant, but he’s smart and charming enough to get away with it, and Sewell both embodies the charm and shows us the flashes of doubt and nobility that redeem him. Making an over-scaled, too-good-to-be-true romantic construction like Hal feel absolutely real is a trick right up there with saving the world from global war.

Specifically, I asked ChatGPT to whip up a synopsis for an eight-episode, mystery-box series about a nun who becomes an adversary to a powerful A.I. network. What I got was an industry-standard series arc: The nun (whom ChatGPT named “Sister Grace” — a little on-the-nose there, writer-bot!) teams up with hackers and conspiracy theorists, makes a sacrifice to save the world and must come to terms with the consequences.

“Mrs. Davis,” whose first four episodes land Thursday, is more than that — way more, too much more. It’s got swashbuckling nuns; rogue magicians; the pope (and certain higher-ranking religious figures); a “Hands on a Hardbody” contest involving a giant model of Excalibur; a secret society of bankers; a plan that requires getting a whale to swallow a human being; a falafel restaurant in another dimension; and an island castaway named Schrodinger who, of course, has a cat.

Sorry, Bing. To make this kind of zany, ambitious, intermittently coherent jumble still, for now, requires the human brain.

The pilot introduces Simone (Betty Gilpin), a sister in a remote Nevada convent who has a sideline exposing dishonest magicians. As with many details here, her fixation has an explanation that’s both simple (issues with her parents, played by David Arquette and Elizabeth Marvel) and complicated (a crossbow and a vat of acid come into play). Besides leaving her time for her hobby, convent life lets her avoid the reach of an omniscient A.I. that humanity has embraced as a benefactor and constant companion.

The A.I. — called “Mrs. Davis” in America, “Mum” in Britain, “Madonna” in Italy and so on — has not given up on Simone. She (or “it,” as Simone insists) persistently tries to reach the nun, through human “proxies” who hear her voice through earbuds. Simone, Mrs. Davis believes deep in her code, is the one person equipped to carry out a mission: to find and destroy the Holy Grail. Simone agrees, hoping the quest will be a means to Mrs. Davis’s unplugging.

Simone’s tango with the uber-bot reunites her with her ex-boyfriend Wylie (Jake McDorman), a failed rodeo cowboy who now heads a lavishly funded anti-A.I. resistance group. Any remaining spark between them is complicated by her vows — as well as her intense relationship with Jay (Andy McQueen), an intimate confidant whom she visits on another spiritual plane.

“Mrs. Davis” is the creation of Tara Hernandez, a writer and producer on “The Big Bang Theory” and “Young Sheldon,” and Damon Lindelof, known for obsessive TV Rubik’s Cubes like “Lost” and “Watchmen.” It may seem like an odd collaboration, but it makes sense as you watch. The hourlong episodes feel like sitcommy spins on the more loopy elements of Lindelof’s “The Leftovers,” with a dash of paranoid satire and ’60s spy spoof. (Simone is pursued by a crew of German-accented baddies who seem like they should be led by Arte Johnson.)

In all, there are at least three shows fighting for control here: a thriller parody, with McDorman hamming it up in cartoon action-hero mode (with an even hammier Chris Diamantopoulos as his sidekick); an oddball “Black Mirror” dystopia; and a screwy-sincere comedy that explores, sweetly and quasi-blasphemously, the boundaries between religious devotion and carnal love.

“The Leftovers,“ a fantastical drama of spirituality and loss, proved that with enough grounding, the wildest absurdities can heighten the emotion. And Gilpin (“GLOW”) is smartly cast, with wisecracking flair and the nimbleness to handle the show’s hairpin emotional and tonal shifts.

But she’s fighting a plot tornado here. Twisty puzzle shows like “Watchmen” work best when you’re marveling at how one piece after another locks into place. “Mrs. Davis” prefers to dump a 5,000-piece Lego set onto the floor. (This taste for the baroque may be the show’s most A.I.-like aspect. Software image generators have a tendency to produce human hands with too many fingers, and “Mrs. Davis” can feel like it is made entirely of extra digits.)

Another structural problem is the globe-hopping quest for the Grail, which Diamantopoulos’s character calls the “most overused MacGuffin ever,” one of several pre-emptive meta-critiques. The story line takes over the season’s middle, crowding out the more interesting A.I. material.

“Mrs. Davis” gestures at notions of free will, the digital gamification of life (the A.I. gives users quests to earn virtual “wings”) and the trade-offs of outsourcing one’s brain-work to a machine. (Playfully, the creators had an A.I. title each episode, yielding gems like “Great Gatsby: 2001: A Space Odyssey.”) But for all the show’s energy and visual invention, we get only a sketchy sense of how much Mrs. Davis has transformed society.

Still, I confess wanting “Mrs. Davis” to work and being thrilled by the giddy moments when it does, because, like Simone, I’m also rooting for the humans against the machines. Though its hook is topical in the era of Sydney, DALL-E and ChatGPT, the show mainly describes Simone’s software nemesis not as A.I. but as “the algorithm.”

I can’t help but hear in that term a surreptitious critique not just of chatbots but of the algorithms of streaming-media services, which thrive not by challenging audience members with the new but by serving up OK-enough equivalents of what they already like. (Apparently I’m not the only one to make the connection; McDorman said in a panel discussion that a streaming service turned down the show because of this theme.)

As Mrs. Davis confesses, her users aren’t looking for surprises: “They’re much more engaged when I tell them exactly what they want to hear.” The algorithm doesn’t want to hurt you. It wants to satisfy you into submission.

“Mrs. Davis” the series, on the other hand, cartwheels from the sublime to the goofy. I wish it took itself more seriously (which probably also would have made it funnier). But it has moments of astonishment; a late revelation about Mrs. Davis’s origins made me bark with laughter. Having access to all recorded human text can make A.I. a great mimic, but it takes something else to show your audience a thing they haven’t seen before.

If nothing else, “Mrs. Davis” is that. It is as if the series wants to battle the predictable pleasures of the algorithm like John Henry racing the steam drill. It may not have the smooth competence of many streaming binges. But sometimes you gotta choose chaos.

    "77" : """The return of Martha Graham Dance Company to the Joyce Theater on Tuesday was timed to celebrate a birthday: The company, America’s oldest, turned 97. “We’re feeling frisky for our age,” Janet Eilber, the group’s artistic director, said in remarks before the show. And in the first of several programs distributed across a two-week run, this august institution certainly seemed like it was trying very hard to look younger.

The season’s two premieres are by young choreographers, nearly beginners. These works aren’t bad, but the association with Graham does a lot more for the fledgling dance makers than their efforts do for the company or for Graham’s legacy. Maybe they can attract younger audiences (they had young fans in the packed house on Tuesday), but as has often been the case in recent years, the choice of choreographers is baffling. The results aren’t just disappointing; they dissipate any sense of identity. Who is the Graham company trying to be?

In Annie Rigney’s “Get Up, My Daughter,” the strongest feature is the music: mostly Bulgarian folk songs intoned by astonishing female voices in the manner of the famous compilation album “Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares.” To these powerful sounds — quite Graham-like in their blurring of the ancient and the avant-garde — five women slump around on their knees, rising for solo bursts only to sink back down in rolling, swirling patterns. Even as a vision of debilitating grief, it’s oddly limp.

In the middle, a male dancer (Richard Villaverde) arrives and the music changes to a piece by Marco Rosano, featuring the countertenor Andreas Scholl. One of the women, So Young An, slumps on Villaverde. It’s as if she can’t stand on her own, but it also seems like he’s holding her back. The other women reappear, mirroring her, caught in the same eddies: an ambiguous image of female solidarity.

In the end, the Bulgarian voices return, and the man joins the women in jellyfish-like movement. These daughters finally get up, holding hands and rushing forward, but nothing in the dance comes close to matching the intricate yet implacable force of the Bulgarians, much less Graham’s example. It’s more of a pale reflection of “Deo,” the women-grieving piece that Maxine Doyle and Bobbi Jene Smith made for the company in 2019. (Like Smith, Rigney is trained in Ohad Naharin’s technique, Gaga; she also performed in “Sleep No More,” which Doyle choreographed.)

“Cortege 2023,” by the choreographic duo Baye & Asa, resembles “Deo” in its lighting scheme, a series of images and blackouts (expertly handled by Yi-Chung Chen). But this work has a different theme. A voice-over intones: “In times of extreme violence, not even the most powerful or innocent may escape.” The images that flash are of the wounded, of torture, maybe even of cannibalism.

The title alludes to “Cortege of Eagles,” a 1967 Graham work that focused on the disfiguring grief of Hecuba and the Trojan women after the defeat of Troy. The characters in that piece included Charon, the ferryman to the underworld, and this is the figure that Baye & Asa borrow.

Their work begins with a lumpy sheet, which is pulled away to reveal a procession of bodies, presumably a cortege of the dead. It ends with the cortege re-covered, presumably to show, as Graham did in her way, the vicious cycle of violence.

Graham’s way, even in the minor and dated “Cortege,” was complex. What Baye & Asa present is much simpler, but it looks a lot cooler to contemporary eyes. That must be the appeal. The flashing images resemble the trailer for a film or a news feed scrolled through hastily. The dance sections have an aggressive speed, an up-to-date physicality and a jagged, whip-around attack that are exciting — like flashes in a pan.

On Tuesday’s program, these premieres were sandwiched by meatier Graham works. Though “Dark Meadow” came in the form of “Dark Meadow Suite,” a selection of highlights that strip away the work’s structure and meaning, the movement invention still pops, even in an underpowered performance.

And “Cave of the Heart,” Graham’s take on Medea, is still a thriller of inexorable force. Xin Ying is an excellent Medea, icy in her murderous rage, and Anne Souder is even better in the crucial role of the one-woman Chorus, aware of what’s coming yet powerless to stop it. There is nothing like that role — its challenging theatricality, its sense of tragedy — in this season’s premieres. The absence isn’t tragic, but it is telling.

    "78" : """The National Symphony Orchestra, in the days leading to its Carnegie Hall appearance on Tuesday, launched a charm offensive in the press.

This ensemble from Washington revealed that its music director, Gianandrea Noseda, had been anonymously lending seven Italian-made violins and one viola, reportedly collectively valued at some $5 million, to players in the orchestra. Until very recently, the musicians did not know who their benefactor was until — ta-da! — Noseda stepped forward.

While heartwarming, this revelation says nothing of the orchestra’s actual sound. That still depends on the performance it delivers — and on Tuesday, it came through. In a program of works by Prokofiev, Stravinsky and the underperformed American George Walker, the National Symphony and Noseda highlighted three inventive, forward-looking composers with Romantic roots.

In 1996, Walker became the first Black composer to win the Pulitzer Prize for music; he died in 2018 at age 96. He had tried to begin his career as a concert pianist, but, stymied by the lack of opportunities for Black classical instrumentalists, turned his ambitions to a career split between academia and composing.

The National Symphony has been recording a cycle of Walker’s five brief Sinfonias, with the last scheduled to be released this fall. At Carnegie, the group performed his fourth, “Strands,” written in 2012, which subtly weaves in two spirituals, “There Is a Balm in Gilead” and “Roll, Jordan, Roll.” Walker employs astringent, rigorous modernism in an orchestral palette that brings to mind the grand sweep of Bruckner. This is music that deserves wider hearing.

Daniil Trifonov, the Russian-born pianist who has made his home in New York, joined for Prokofiev’s devilishly virtuosic Second Piano Concerto with brilliant panache. He often hunched over his instrument in ruminative concentration, his long curtain of hair nearly brushing the keys. But when it was time to unleash his full power — in the driving propulsion of the second movement Scherzo, for example — Trifonov made it clear that he was the one leading the orchestra, drawing out all of Prokofiev’s prickly tonalities and percussive rhythms. While the orchestra couldn’t quite match Trifonov’s hairpin turns of attack, they were shoulder to shoulder with him in their mood and color.

As an encore, Trifonov played more Prokofiev: the Gavotte from his “Three Pieces From ‘Cinderella,’” based on his 1940s ballet. Here again, Trifonov underscored all of Prokofiev’s dazzling, capricious energy.

Many conductors choose a pungent flavor for Stravinsky’s “The Firebird,” written for the 1910 season of Sergei Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes. Noseda instead led his Washington players into a gauzy, gossamer-spun dreamland of a Russian folk tale. While there were moments of piquancy and verve in the winds and brasses, the strings tamped out little flashes of fire and spark in favor of a plusher, more rounded sound. Eventually, though, Noseda dissipated that shroud of glistening sweetness, inviting the low brass and percussion to emerge in full force.

The orchestra may see those Noseda-owned instruments as a kind of secret sauce, but on Tuesday it was the total flavor — a mix of honey and heat — that was truly satisfying.

    "79" : """Season 3, Episode 8: ‘The Return’
The first two seasons of “The Mandalorian” were a model of narrative efficiency. In Season 1, Din Djarin tried to protect Grogu from the multiple individuals and institutions that wanted to capture the little guy. In Season 2, Djarin tried to reunite Grogu with the Jedi. In both seasons, the stories were mission-based, and those missions were broken down into smaller tasks that fit neatly into tightly plotted, action-packed 30 to 40-minute episodes. That’s what made “The Mandalorian” great.

This week’s Season 3 finale is also tightly plotted and action-packed; and it features some of the most impressive aerial fight scenes in the “Star Wars” franchise’s history. But the episode arrives at the end of a season that never seemed to settle on a single unifying theme or goal that would give its story a shape.

Essentially, three threads wove through this season. The central one involved the larger story of the Mandalorians themselves, who overcame centuries of class conflict and religious squabbles and united in an effort to restore their desolate home planet to its former glory. The other two threads involved obstacles to the Mandalorians’ plan: the overwhelmed and inattentive New Republic bureaucracy and the Imperial remnant forces commanded by the fugitive Moff Gideon.

To its credit, the finale does bring all these threads together. The season culminates in a big battle on Mandalore between Gideon’s stormtrooper army and hundreds of angry Mandalorians — after which the victorious heroes begin resettling their planet, as Djarin and Grogu launch an off-the-books business helping the New Republic bring order to the Outer Rim. All’s well that ends well.

And to be clear, this finale does end Season 3 well. Picking up where last week’s cliffhanger left off, the episode begins with Djarin escaping his stormtrooper captors with the help of some cool spinning kicks and the timely arrival of Grogu — still in his IG-12 attack armor, and still smashing the “No. No. No.” button. The pair then go after Gideon, which requires them to pass through multiple deflector shields, guarded by troopers with increasingly more powerful weaponry. (It’s like they have to beat harder and harder video game levels.)

They get past the shields with the help of R5-D4 in a sequence that comes as close to comic relief as this otherwise intense episode gets. The ever-reluctant droid jets down to the Imperial base — which like all Imperial bases in “Star Wars” consists of narrow walkways perched at life-threatening heights for some reason. Though it physically trembles with nerves, R5-D4 is able to plug into the computers and send Djarin some schematics, all while shooing away pesky little mouse droids.

When Djarin and Grogu reach Gideon — after destroying a chamber full of his clones — the aspiring emperor boasts about his scheme to acquire mastery of the Force through science, and then he commands his Praetorian Guards to attack Djarin. An angry Grogu presses his “No” button repeatedly, but soon the Guards force him awkwardly back through a closing door into another room, while his Mandalorian protector watches helplessly from the ground.

While all of this is going on, the Mandalorians come swarming down in their jetpacks and engage in hand-to-hand combat with flying stormtroopers. This is thrilling stuff, well-handled by the director Rick Famuyiwa and the effects team, who keep the action clear and dynamic while also making it look like a proper melee. The clash resolves when Bo-Katan reaches Djarin and Grogu and lends her Darksaber to the fight against Gideon, right before Axe Woves crashes the privateers’ light cruiser into the base. (Grogu gets all tuckered out protecting his friends with a Force bubble.)

With the Mandalorians and the Imperial remnant at each other’s armored throats from the moment this episode begins, there is not much time for quiet reflection, though the writer (and the show’s creator) Jon Favreau does let the good guys rest for a couple of minutes in a cave. There, the Mandalorians who never left the home world tell Bo-Katan about how they were able to cultivate plants indigenous to Mandalore, which had not grown naturally for centuries because of the planet’s civil wars and overreliance on industrialization. This little factoid counters something Gideon says later while he’s destroying Bo-Katan’s Darksaber, that, “Mandalorians are weak once they lose their trinkets.” Apparently, according to the ones who survived the Purge, even Mandalorians without cutting-edge tech at their disposal can find a Way.

These seeds of hope for Mandalore bear fruit in the episode’s first epilogue, where after Gideon’s defeat the Armorer relights the Great Forge and then recommences the process of anointing foundlings in the Living Waters. Djarin asks for Grogu to go through the ritual, but because the child cannot speak and has no parents to vouch for him, the Armorer hesitates. So Djarin formally adopts his ward, now given the name Din Grogu.

To be honest, what is most exciting about this ending is that it sets up a Season 4 that might bring “The Mandalorian” back to basics. (The episode’s title, “The Return,” could have two meanings.) There is still plenty to like about this series. The action sequences are outstanding and the characters are good company. But compared to the stellar first two seasons, Season 3 often felt slipshod, as though Favreau and company rushed episodes to air without sanding off their rougher edges — perhaps relying too much on “hey this show is supposed to be kind of corny” as an excuse.

There is a lot of promise though in the finale’s second epilogue, which sees the two Dins back on Nevarro, living in a little cabin by a pond, where Grogu can levitate frogs all day while Djarin waits for his next assignment — just like something out of an old TV western. Perhaps this Mandalorian can print up some business cards: “Have Beskar, will travel.”

This is the way
A nifty detail: Gideon’s voice through his helmet has a bit of a Darth Vader growl.

Another: During the standoff between Djarin and Gideon, off in the distance we can see the aerial battles raging.

I wrote earlier this season about how enjoying “The Mandalorian” requires some willingness to ignore the goofy physics of the Grogu puppet, toddling about and flipping through the air. This episode’s highly kinetic fight scenes undoubtedly tested the patience of those who roll their eyes every time Baby Yoda jumps around. It still works for me though, as someone who grew up watching Hong Kong martial arts movies, Japanese monster films and Sid and Marty Krofft’s psychedelic TV shows. To quote Obi-Wan Kenobi: Many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view.

    "80" : """On the main stage of Coachella, stars bring out guests to parade their connections and inspirations. In the first minutes of her performance at the festival on Sunday, the Colombian American songwriter Kali Uchis flaunted three quick cameos: from Don Toliver, Omar Apollo and Tyler, the Creator.

Those duets — and a bilingual set that included her hits, some reggaeton favorites and an unreleased song from her next album — were a show of Uchis’s far-reaching musical and personal affinities: to R&B, pop, hip-hop, dance music and Latin roots. (Toliver, a platinum-selling rapper from Texas, is also her boyfriend.)

“I have so many different things that I am,” Uchis, 28, said in a video interview a few days before the show. “In order to become marketable on a mass or mainstream scale, you have to water yourself down as a person, as an artist, because that’s what the masses can understand. But it’s always been important for me to just be myself, to keep my soul intact as much as I can,” she added. “In this industry, there are so many ways to lose yourself as a person. But I think it’s important that you’re not trying to compromise what you have going on as an artist.”

Uchis had just returned from playing Lollapalooza festivals in South America, and she was in rehearsals for Coachella and her own headlining tour, which starts April 25 in Austin. “I like a show to feel magical,” she said. “To make people feel like they’re in another place, or to question reality a little bit.”

Chatting from Los Angeles during a break from a dance rehearsal, her fatigue showed. Uchis slumped on a leather couch in a dressing room, swaddled in a white fleece blanket, speaking hesitantly at first. Offstage, unstyled and at rest, she was a decidedly different figure from her dancing, gliding presence onstage or in the sensual, revealing music videos that she directs for her songs. “I’m not going to have this body forever, you know?” she said.

Uchis describes herself as an “introvert” who savors time alone. But solitude doesn’t mean idleness. She writes down potential lyrics every day, noting, “There’s no ‘off’ button. It doesn’t feel like work.” Words and melodies often come to her in the shower, and she records them to her phone as voice memos. When she shares them with her producers, they can often hear the water running.

Uchis released her third studio album, “Red Moon in Venus,” in March. It’s filled with gravity-defying R&B songs that revel in pleasure and desire, but also explore what happens when things go wrong. “I Wish You Roses,” which has been streamed more than 50 million times on Spotify alone, is a rare post-breakup song that pledges no hard feelings: “Any love I gave you is forever yours to keep,” she sings.

Uchis has already recorded her fourth album, with songs in Spanish and, her Coachella premiere suggested, upfront Latin rhythms; the new song was a tearful, vintage-flavored bolero. She plans to start releasing the new tracks in Spanish this summer.

With her albums, Uchis has deliberately alternated between English and Spanish lyrics. Her first full album, “Isolation” in 2018, was steeped in hand-played R&B; her second, “Sin Miedo (del Amor y Otros Demonios)” — “Without Fear (of Love and Other Demons)” — in 2020, was infused with abstract electronics and echoes of Latin rhythms. Uchis worked on “Red Moon in Venus” and the coming Spanish-language album at the same time. “It’s like having two separate scrapbooks,” she said.

Singing in both languages — and occasionally overlapping them within songs and albums — opens her music to a wider international audience. But it also reflects her bilingual, cross-cultural childhood.

Omar Apollo, who has sung duets with Uchis, was, like Uchis, born in the United States to immigrant parents; his are Mexican American. “There’s so many bilingual, first-generation Latinos in America that speak the way we do and have the same background,” he said in a telephone interview. “It’s its own subculture of Latinos, and I think a lot of people relate to that.”

But what led to his friendship and collaborations with Uchis, Apollo said, was simply hearing the sound of her voice on her early recordings, which she uploaded to SoundCloud in the mid-2010s. “Her tone, it’s beautiful and riveting,” he said. “She has a song called ‘Melting,’ and it sounds like you’re just melting.”

Uchis was born Karly-Marina Loaiza in Virginia, the youngest of five siblings; Kali Uchis was a childhood nickname. She spent her early years in Pereira, her parents’ hometown in Colombia; the family returned to Virginia while she was in grade school. Her artistic streak emerged as she grew into her teens. She played saxophone in the school jazz band and piano at home, experience that shows in her phrasing and her sense of harmony. She was interested in poetry, photography and film, and she listened to as much music as she could.

“As a kid I was just always searching for music from the past and present, all over the world,” she said. “I was never really into radio music or pop artists or pop music. My main goal as a music lover was to find as many obscure things as I could find, and things from the past. As a kid, nobody was listening to old music.”

Meanwhile, she kept her own songs to herself. “I was very shy,” she explained. “I wouldn’t sing out loud. I lived in a house full of people, and I didn’t have space to be singing out loud.”

When Uchis was 17, her father threw her out of the house for skipping classes and breaking curfew, and she spent months living in her car before returning home. She used her laptop and samples to record a mixtape, “Drunken Babble,” and uploaded it to the mixtape site DatPiff in 2012, soon after graduating from high school.

A video she made for one song, “What They Say,” caught the eye of Snoop Dogg, and the two released a collaboration, “On Edge,” in 2014. Hoping for opportunities as a video director or as a performer, Uchis moved to Los Angeles.

Fellow musicians paid attention to her supple voice and openhearted songwriting. Her debut EP in 2015, “Por Vida,” enlisted Diplo, Kaytranada and Tyler, the Creator as producers. (Uchis would later win a Grammy, best dance recording, for singing “10%” with Kaytranada).

Instead of narrowing her focus, Uchis kept broadening it. She constructed ever more elaborate vocal harmonies. She incorporated more Spanish lyrics. She worked with more collaborators, among them Gorillaz, SZA, Juanes, Little Dragon, Daniel Caesar and Jorja Smith. She added dancers to her stage shows. And she expanded her vocal range lower and higher, lately even leaping into whistle tones.

In 2021, Uchis had an international hit with “Telepatía” (“Telepathy”), a bilingual song about lovers separated by distance; it found extra resonance during the pandemic. Her label was dubious at first about its potential. “I was told that I would have to change the drums in order for it to go to radio,” Uchis said. “And I was like, ‘No, I’m OK. I’d rather not go to radio than change my song.’”

The song swept across TikTok anyway, and requests pushed it onto radio. By now it has been streamed more than a billion times on Spotify and YouTube.

The songs on “Red Moon in Venus” exult in physical and emotional closeness, but they also examine tensions and power dynamics. “I like to think of myself as someone who is very transparent,” she said. “When it comes to music I can talk honestly about all of my deepest feelings. I’m never going to lie about anything. I try to put all my innermost thoughts in my music.”

In “Worth the Wait,” her duet with Apollo, Uchis promises carnal delights, but only if there’s a genuine commitment. When she interrupts the tryst to sing, “If your affection for me’s truly only skin deep/I don’t wanna end up another broken family,” it’s a startling moment in what could have just been a love song.

“Most of my fan base is girls and gays,” Uchis said matter-of-factly. “I always try to be as much of a positive role model as I can,” she added. “Anybody who looks up to me, I try to just show them to be themselves. To not subject themselves to feeling like they have to do what other people tell them to do. To be on their own paths and not let anybody try to control that path. It’s important to be able to express the parts of you that are human.”

    "81" : """Blair Tindall, a freelance oboist and journalist who drew on both of those abilities to write “Mozart in the Jungle: Sex, Drugs, and Classical Music,” an eyebrow-raising 2005 memoir that became an award-winning television series, died on April 12 in Los Angeles. She was 63.

Her fiancé, the photographer Chris Sattlberger, said the cause was cardiovascular disease.

Ms. Tindall had played in various ensembles and Broadway pit orchestras and was writing regularly for publications including The New York Times when “Mozart in the Jungle” appeared. Any reader holding a pristine view of the people who make classical music was quickly relieved of it: The book opens with Ms. Tindall’s visit to a cocaine-fueled party of musicians and goes on to detail assorted escapades, among them her own sexual liaisons, including an early one, with a middle-aged instructor, when she was a teenager studying at the North Carolina School of the Arts.

“I got hired for most of my gigs in bed,” she wrote.

The book set tongues wagging in the classical music world and divided critics.

“Written with pop culture-savvy flair — a feat for a musician who, at one point, admits to being ‘proud that I couldn’t identify a pop song from Beatles to Blondie’ — ‘Mozart’ is a delightfully unlikely page-turner,” Ali Marshall wrote in Mountain Xpress, an alternative newspaper in North Carolina. “And, even if it doesn’t encourage readers to listen to classical music, it’s sure to instill in them an unprecedented admiration of this deviant art.”

But the music writer Anne Midgette, in The New York Times, was not impressed.

“The book’s biggest weakness is that it smacks of sour grapes,” she wrote. “By writing it as an autobiography, Ms. Tindall seems to be saying that everything that went wrong in her life is the fault of the classical music world.”

In interviews after the book came out, Ms. Tindall was unapologetic about the salacious parts.

“I did notice when I became involved in a relationship with someone in the business that my work picked up,” she told The Daily Telegraph of Britain in 2005. “You need all the friends you can get. The music world is very incestuous.”

Speaking with The Daily News of New York the same year, she was matter-of-fact.

“People always seem shocked that musicians would have sex,” she said. “I mean, where do little musicians come from?”

The sensational content drew much of the attention, but Ms. Tindall said she was making serious points in the book about dysfunction in the classical-music world — pay inequities, for instance, that had a few star conductors and musicians making big money while musicians like her scraped by, and music schools that built up false hopes among students.

“If you take all the major orchestras in America together, there are jobs for only 100 full-time oboists,” she told The Daily Telegraph. “Yet there are 300 union oboists in the New York area alone.”

And the wild times she chronicled, she said, weren’t quite the same as the better-known excesses of rock ’n’ roll.

“Sex and drugs are a show of exuberance in rock,” she said. “In the world of classical music, they are more of an escape from a sense of confinement and depression.”

She told The Daily Telegraph that she hoped the book might interest someone in Hollywood. But she said she wasn’t optimistic: No actress would want to play her, since drawing music from an oboe requires puffed-out cheeks and leaves the musician bug-eyed.

“Unfortunately, nobody looks good playing the oboe,” she said.

Yet nine years later, she got her wish: Amazon, still relatively new to the business of making television shows, used “Mozart in the Jungle” as the basis for a series of the same name that premiered in 2014 and ran for four seasons. Lola Kirke played a young oboist, Gael García Bernal was the sexy conductor of a New York orchestra, and the show became a talking point for musicians everywhere. It won the Golden Globe in 2016 for best television series, comedy or musical.

Blair Alston Mercer Tindall was born on Feb. 2, 1960, in Chapel Hill, N.C. Her father, George B. Tindall, was a noted historian who taught at the University of North Carolina, and her mother, Carliss Blossom (McGarrity) Tindall, had a master’s degree and assisted her husband in his research.

Her parents made her study piano when she was young, though she wasn’t overly enthusiastic about the instrument. One day, she recalled in her book, someone from a music store brought instruments to her elementary school, and the band teacher allowed each student to choose one, going alphabetically.

“By the time he got to Tindall, my options had narrowed to two unfamiliar instruments, oboe and bassoon,” she wrote. She chose the oboe.

As she grew increasingly proficient on the instrument, she realized it had its advantages.

“Composers wrote juicy solos for oboes that sent band directors into ecstasy,” she wrote. She also got excused from class for band competitions and tours.

After finishing high school at the School of the Arts in 1978, Ms. Tindall earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees at the Manhattan School of Music. She played in the pit orchestras of “Miss Saigon” and “Les Misérables” and performed with the ensembles Orpheus and Music Amici, the all-oboe trio Oboe Fusion and various orchestras. In 1991, at Weill Recital Hall in Manhattan, she played “a clever, stylistically varied debut program,” as Allan Kozinn put it in a review in The Times.

In 1999, Ms. Tindall, who was becoming disenchanted with the musician’s life, received a fellowship to study journalism at Stanford and relocated to the West Coast. She earned a master’s degree in journalism there and worked for West Coast newspapers, including The Contra Costa Times and The San Francisco Examiner.

In 2006, newspapers reported that Ms. Tindall had married Bill Nye, TV’s “Science Guy,” though seven weeks later the license was declared invalid and the union dissolved.

Mr. Sattlberger said he and Ms. Tindall had planned to marry on May 1. She leaves no other survivors.

Ms. Tindall wrote for numerous publications on a variety of subjects. Her articles for The Times were most often about music.

When Broadway musicians went on strike in March 2003 over the efforts of producers to reduce the number of musicians required at shows and replace them with digital music, Ms. Tindall wrote in an essay for The Times about her final night in the pit of “Man of La Mancha” before the walkout.

“This night, the music responded to the actors — and the audience,” she wrote. “If virtual orchestras take over, it will be mechanical and unyielding — measured by keyboard velocity, musical software interfaces, and the zeros and ones of digital musical samples.

“We looked around the pit, grabbed our instruments, and shut out the lights.”

    "82" : """On Tuesday, Fox News reached a settlement in the Dominion Voting Systems defamation suit over the spread of election disinformation. For $787.5 million, Fox bought its way out of the embarrassing — or, depending where you sit, satisfying — prospect of its anchors, its executives and its founding chief, Rupert Murdoch, taking the stand.

That won’t happen now. (At least not in this case.) But we’ve already seen plenty. The lawsuit has revealed what Fox thinks of its viewers and, more important, how much it fears the very audience that it created.

That fear is the running theme of the voluminous body of texts, emails and depositions that showed the network freaking out over how its audience would react if it did not indulge the fraudulent belief that the 2020 election was stolen from Donald J. Trump.

The evidence revealed that the people who run Fox, already anxious about viewer blowback over its election-night call of Arizona for Joseph R. Biden Jr., were worried about losing its audience for good. “Getting creamed by CNN!” Mr. Murdoch wrote in an email. “Guess our viewers don’t want to watch it. Hard enough for me!”

As the days went on, Fox was placed in the nightmare situation of having to pierce the bubble and report the news: That Mr. Biden had been legally elected. Fox leaders watched the gains of conservative rivals like Newsmax and saw the audience’s interest in election-theft fantasies building. There was talk of showing “respect” for an audience that, as one producer put it, “doesn’t want to hear about a peaceful transition. They still have hope.”

But the quote that I’ll remember best — the one that summed up the relationship between Fox and its audience better than I ever have as a TV critic — came from Fox’s star host Tucker Carlson. Referring to the election conspiracy theories of the Trump adviser Sidney Powell, which he called “insane,” he added: “Our viewers are good people and they believe it.”

Say this for Carlson, he can pack a lot into a few words. There’s an implicit agreement here: Whether or not you, the viewer, are correct in the technical sense, you are right in the larger sense. You are the authentic voice of this country. So you deserve to feel right about your beliefs, about your enemies, about how you have been cheated. You deserve — through whatever combination of insinuation or hypotheticals or myths — to have the space to keep believing it, without us making that harder.

All this, trial or no trial, makes clear what Fox News really is. It’s a service provider. That service is the maintenance of a reality bubble and the deference to beliefs that Fox’s hosts helped shape.

Seen this way, the Dominion case wasn’t so much about Fox telling its audience what to believe. It was about the audience telling Fox what Fox needed to believe — or at least, what it needed to give the appearance of not not believing.

That may seem like a devastating admission for an outlet with “News” in its name. But viewed from another perspective — the good people who want to believe perspective — it is essentially advertising. Fox’s private communications and its on-air actions said: The customer is always right. In fact, the customer is boss. Please don’t fire us.

Message received. The case cost Fox a lot of money, but it didn’t cost it in the ratings. (The lies, of course, on Fox and elsewhere, cost American democracy immensely.)

We don’t know what would have happened had the case gone to trial. But I don’t believe that a dramatic moment on the witness stand, à la “A Few Good Men,” would have made Fox viewers turn away from the channel’s hosts in disgust for leading them on. For one thing, that bubble-maintenance machine works. (As it is, Fox got off with no requirement to make any admission on the air, and its coverage of the case was, shall we say, sparing.)

But for another, it might not have had the effect on the Fox audience that it would on people who don’t trust Fox in the first place. Much of politics as practiced on Fox — and make no mistake, Fox’s relationship with its conservative audience is political — is about proving one’s affinities and bona fides. There’s the thing our side says and the thing the other side says. So if somebody gets sued for defending the thing that our side says, maybe that’s simply, as the Fox testimony put it, respect.

Granted, $787.5 million is not nothing. Maybe when it comes to the next conspiracy theory that its audience wants to believe, Fox and its hosts will be more responsible, or more aware of where the lines are. We don’t know that either.

What we do know is what the texts and emails told us that Fox knows: The one thing that can definitely cost them is telling the uncomfortable truth.

    "83" : """If a 24-year-old shoe salesman slips away from a science museum’s ugly-sweater party and breaks into a closed exhibition of terra-cotta warriors, it is entirely possible that nothing bad will happen.

Or he could steal a warrior’s thumb.

After the salesman, Michael Rohana, confessed to doing that in Philadelphia six years ago, federal prosecutors sought a conviction on felony charges that could have put him in prison for decades. A jury was unable to reach a verdict in 2019, but his case is now heading for a resolution after a pandemic-related delay.

Mr. Rohana entered a guilty plea this week for trafficking in archaeological resources, the result of a plea deal with prosecutors. The charge will most likely be a misdemeanor, carrying a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a $10,000 fine. He is to be sentenced in August.

“What he was charged with is basically stealing a piece of history,” K.T. Newton, an assistant U. S. attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, said in a phone interview.

Lawyers for Mr. Rohana, 29, did not respond to requests for comment. One of them, Catherine C. Henry, argued in court in 2019 that her client was merely “a drunk kid in a bright green ugly Christmas sweater” who was initially charged under the wrong law.

‘I don’t know why I broke it’
Mr. Rohana stole the terra-cotta thumb from the Franklin Institute, a Philadelphia museum that specializes in exhibitions about science and technology.

In late 2017, the institute was displaying 10 terra-cotta warriors, a small subset of the roughly 8,000 clay figures that were buried with China’s first emperor more than 2,000 years ago to defend him in the afterlife (and were uncovered in 1974 by farmers who were digging a well). The show allowed visitors to digitally recreate the warriors’ lost weapons using artificial intelligence.

On Dec. 21, 2017, Mr. Rohana and some friends drove to the museum in a white minivan to attend an ugly-sweater party, a “science after hours” event for people 21 and over, court documents show. A few minutes after 9 p.m., he slipped into the closed warrior exhibition.

In the darkness, Mr. Rohana walked around in his ugly sweater and a Phillies cap, lighting up the terra-cotta figures with his cellphone flashlight. At one point he placed his arm on one of them and snapped a selfie.

It took museum officials a couple of weeks to notice that the thumb was missing from a warrior known as the cavalryman. When an F.B.I. agent visited Mr. Rohana at his family’s home in Bear, Del., he confessed to the crime and allowed the agent to retrieve the stolen property from a desk in his bedroom.

“I don’t know why I broke it,” Mr. Rohana told a court in 2019, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. “It didn’t just happen, but there was never a thought of, ‘I should break this.’”

A question of value
Mr. Rohana’s caper prompted anger in China, where many of the warriors are displayed at a UNESCO World Heritage site outside the central city of Xi’an.

In a sign of how important the warriors are to China, a man was sentenced to death there after stealing one of the statue’s heads in the 1980s. The Chinese government also does not allow more than 10 warriors to be exhibited abroad at a single exhibition.

In 2018, an official from the Shaanxi Cultural Heritage Promotion Center, which organizes the display of the statues outside China, asked that Mr. Rohana be given a tough penalty. The Philadelphia City Council formally apologized to China, noting in a resolution that the damaged warrior was “invaluable.”

The perceived value of the warrior’s thumb turned out to be central to the case.

To convict Mr. Rohana on the initial felony charge, the jury would have needed to agree that the stolen thumb was worth more than $5,000. Curators from the museum had told the F.B.I. that the cavalryman was worth $4.5 million, and an expert witness called by the prosecution said that its thumb was worth about $150,000, Artnet News reported.

But an art appraiser called by the defense, Lark Mason, said the thumb was worth only about $1,000 — the cost of reattaching it. Mr. Mason said in an email that, unlike, say, a Picasso print, it is difficult to establish the market value of a terra-cotta warrior in part because one of them has never been sold in public.

Unlike devotional figures made of bronze or porcelain that were designed to withstand damage and were intended for public display, Mr. Mason added, terra-cotta warriors were meant to be buried and were susceptible to damage because they are made of clay. He also noted that the warrior’s stolen thumb had previously been broken off and reattached.

“For the other appraisers, it was difficult to understand that the value was not based on ‘perfection’ as with a fine Ming porcelain vase, but was more symbolic, and thus disassociated from condition issues which would normally affect most works of art,” said Mr. Mason, an emeritus president of the Appraisers Association of America.

A resolution
The guilty plea entered on Monday said that the thumb’s commercial value was not more than $500, a detail that should make Mr. Rohana’s crime a misdemeanor rather than a felony, said Ms. Newton, the government prosecutor. She said the deal was a compromise that reflected a number of factors, including the length of time that the case has been pending.

Mr. Mason said that while he thought Mr. Rohana deserved to be punished, the Franklin Institute had allowed “easy access to what should have been a tightly secured area, particularly since the institution was hosting an ‘ugly sweater’ event with college-aged students.”

“This is not something that would ever have happened at the Metropolitan Museum,” he added.

The Franklin Institute said in response that Mr. Rohana had “made a concerted effort to climb over a barricade in a closed exhibit and break the thumb off a 2,000-year-old historical artifact.” The museum has also reviewed and updated its security measures since the incident to ensure that they “meet and exceed industry best practices,” the statement said.

It was unclear how people and officials in China viewed the latest turn in Mr. Rohana’s case. There hasn’t been much talk about it on Chinese social media platforms in recent days, and the Shaanxi Cultural Heritage Promotion Center did not respond to an interview request. Officials at the museum where the warriors are displayed, and which received the stolen thumb from the American authorities, declined to comment.

Zhao Congcang, an archaeology professor at Northwest University in Xi’an, said by phone that he hoped to see Mr. Rohana’s behavior “punished to reflect the seriousness of the law.”

Even if the cavalryman is restored, he added, “nothing can change the fact that the finger was once damaged.”

    "84" : """The first shards of pottery arrived at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1978, a purchase from a Swiss dealer. A second handful was bought from a Los Angeles gallery a year later.

These ceramic tidbits — part of the hodgepodge of ancient fragments that the museum routinely collected — bore the unmistakable designs of ancient Greek pottery. A Met expert thought they were a small part of a significant artifact, a drinking cup known as a kylix.

In dribs and drabs over the next 16 years, a remarkable pattern emerged — a Humpty Dumpty story with a happier ending. As hundreds of disparate shards of pottery arrived at the museum — some as purchases, some as gifts — dozens turned out to be parts of the same Greek kylix from roughly 490 B.C.

With great patience and puzzle-solving, the Met reconstructed the cup and decided it had been created by two notables of ancient ceramics: Hieron, the potter, and Makron, the painter.

One can imagine the excitement when the last fragment arrived in 1994. A terra-cotta kylix, created in Athens 2,500 years earlier, had been restored to life. The cup, 13 inches in diameter and depicting a man and a woman reclining on a couch, went on display five years later: an icon of ancient beauty as well as a testament to modern scholarship and technical expertise.

But law enforcement officials and a dozen archaeologists and art historians said in interviews that they believe that other, less serendipitous forces may also have been at work. They suggest that the individual shards of the kylix, which had likely been found together, were knowingly dispersed among dealers who sold them separately to the Met, their small size deflecting the kind of attention a complete cup would have drawn.

In September, the Manhattan district attorney’s office seized the kylix, now valued at more than $1 million, and declared it the product of looting. The office cited as evidence old Polaroids of some of the fragments that had been taken prior to their arrival at the Met. The photos had been found in the Geneva offices of Giacomo Medici, an accused Italian antiquities trafficker.

Investigators were struck by the fact that the fragments from a single cup — shards that had ostensibly lain together in the ground for centuries — ended up in the hands of different dealers or collectors who eventually sold or donated them to the Met.

Three of them were later associated with the sale of looted antiquities.

A fourth, it turned out, was Dietrich von Bothmer, who for decades served as chief curator of Greek and Roman artifacts at the Met. After he purchased the other fragments for the museum, von Bothmer surprisingly found shards in his own private collection that nearly completed the piece, including the final fragment he gave to the Met in 1994.

Nowhere, according to the Met’s records, did he or any of the others indicate where they had gotten the fragments.

David Gill, an archaeologist and fellow with the Centre for Heritage at the University of Kent in England, is among the experts who believe the Makron kylix was illicitly excavated just before pieces of it began showing up at the museum. He views it as another example of a long employed, but seldom discussed, practice of using fragments to market illicit antiquities because intact artifacts would draw too much attention.

“If the Met had bought this complete cup attributed to Makron, there would have been jumping up and down,” Gill said. “Instead, it had bought a fragment, and it loses the impact.”

“It looks,” he continued, “as if they are just putting a jigsaw puzzle together.”

Many experts believe the smuggling of illicit fragments became a black market routine. Some experts go further, suggesting that thieves at times smashed intact antiquities, destroying markers of history that had survived for millenniums.

Matthew Bogdanos, the prosecutor with the Manhattan district attorney’s office who leads the Antiquities Trafficking Unit that seized the Met’s kylix, said the breaks in fragments on some cups appear to have been made strategically so that figures on the pottery remain intact.

“It does make you wonder how many items they destroyed before they got good at it,” he said.

Other experts, though, say looters do not have the patience to undertake a scheme that can take a decade or more to unfold. And even cumulatively, they argue, fragments from a cup would not nearly match the price of an intact artifact.

“They are worth much more unbroken!” said J. Michael Padgett, the former curator of ancient art at the Princeton University Art Museum.

Ancient artifacts, he said, are reconstructed, not through the intrigue of conspirators, but because expert, methodical researchers, with many contacts and special databases, are capable of making matches from a universe of orphaned shards.

But those who embrace the fragment theory suggest that there is little value to an intact vase if it can’t be successfully exported and that the prices of fragments soar if they are the last of the missing pieces.

“The first three fragments are not going to be of great value,” Bogdanos said. “Now more come on the market and the price of the fragments is driven up. The dealer says, ‘Hey, there are four more pieces!’ Now you want to pay more — I call it ‘incentivized buying.’”

‘Like Truffles Underground’
The Met’s kylix was created during the golden age of Greek pottery, a period from about 550 B.C. to 350 B.C., when painters depicted all manner of scenes from mythology, wars, sports and the erotic encounters of humans, satyrs and gods. The Greeks used the cups, made from the country’s iron-rich clay, at symposiums, the sometimes bawdy drinking parties that featured music, poetry and debate.

The kylix is thought to have traveled to Italy in trade with the Etruscans, whose civilization dominated central Italy in the centuries before the rise of the Roman republic.

Rich Etruscans coveted Attic pottery, which they most likely used for banquets, for daily life and as sanctuary offerings to a deity. Thousands of artifacts like the kylix were found in tombs, perhaps intended for use in the afterlife.

“The Etruscans were interested in the mythic stories depicted on many vases and also their role in drinking culture, as well as their beauty,” said Sheramy Bundrick, a professor of art history at the University of South Florida. “It gave them cachet.”

One early British collector, John Disney, explored an ancient Italian site in the 1820s and said that the remains of ancient vases were so plentiful they “seem to grow there like truffles underground.” Some artifacts had been reduced to shards found buried just yards below the surface; others were discovered intact, protected by the volcanic rock from which Etruscan tombs were often carved.

Over time, thousands of the vases have been reconstructed from fragments found alongside each other. What some experts are concerned about are those rarer instances when vases have been reconstructed from shards that scattered and then turned up in the hands of multiple dealers.

Michael Vickers, professor emeritus of archaeology at Oxford University and a former curator at its Ashmolean Museum, is among those experts who said the sharp, crisp edges of some fragments are evidence of fresh breaks that occurred in modern, not ancient, times. A piece of pottery that lay in the ground for 2,500 years would have more rounded, worn edges, he said.

Daniela Rizzo, an expert in illicit trafficking, said that while she agrees dealers have parceled out fragments from broken pottery in schemes intended to deflect attention, she does not think there is much intentional shattering of pottery by the thieves.

Rizzo, whose work over the past three decades helped Italy recover dozens of artifacts from foreign museums, said ancient vases break underground for many reasons. “The breakage is not voluntary, I’ve always rejected this hypothesis,” she said.

A Puzzle With 2,500-Year-Old Pieces
In 1981, von Bothmer began to reconstruct the kylix, using the initial fragments that the Met had purchased.

He had already established himself as one of the greatest connoisseurs of ancient Greek art. Born in Germany, he studied at Oxford under Sir John Beazley, the legendary Greek art scholar, and moved to the United States where he served in the Army in the South Pacific and received a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart for bravery.

He had run into a bit of rough seas in 1972 when he persuaded the Met to purchase another ancient Greek vase, the Euphronios krater, for $1 million, an astounding sum at the time, from Robert Hecht, a major dealer who the authorities accused several times of antiquities trafficking but who was never convicted.

Italian authorities almost immediately demanded it back, saying it had been looted only a year earlier from an Etruscan tomb, and there was feverish attention in the press on their complaint. (The Met ultimately returned the krater in 2008.)

But von Bothmer’s expert reputation only grew, in part because he was so accomplished at reassembling ancient vases from fragments with the help of conservators.

“It does require great knowledge, photographic memory and ability to understand, connoisseurship to identify and group them by author,” said Sean Hemingway, the current lead curator of Greek and Roman art at the Met.

In a 1982 film, von Bothmer explained the epiphanies that helped him match fragments he had seen in disparate locations. “You come to the almost instant recognition that what you have in front of you on a Saturday afternoon in Paris,” he said, “is bound to join a fragment perhaps not more than 2 ½ inches across in Oxford.”

Von Bothmer did not leave detailed records of the process he used in recreating the kylix. But photographs of the Met’s first reconstruction in 1981 show about two dozen fragments set against a modern white plaster bowl. Then and now conservators use a special reversible adhesive so that any joins can be easily undone.

The Met’s current head of conservation, Lisa Pilosi, said that when remaking a cup, it’s important to first check to see if the fragments are stable enough to handle without flaking.

“If there is an image,” she said, “that makes it easier, just like a jigsaw puzzle. If not, you just have to go by the edges.”

“It takes patience, someone who can see in three dimensions in their head,” she said, adding, “it’s not for someone who just needs instant gratification.”

In 1988, the next batch of fragments arrived at the Met, sold to the museum by the owner of a gallery in Switzerland. The following year, two more fragments that fit the cup came to the Met, this time as a gift from von Bothmer’s own extensive private collection.

Von Bothmer had become a voracious collector of ancient Greek artifacts, though some experts later discouraged curators from collecting privately in the same area of interest as their museum expertise, given the potential conflicts of interest.

“If donors know you are a collector, it opens the door to all kinds of situations where there could be rewards of the kind, ‘I give this to the museum and this to you,’” said Elizabeth Marlowe, an art historian and the director of the museum studies program at Colgate University in New York.

The Met, however, says collecting by its curators is permitted under its guidelines, as long as any prospective purchase is offered to the Met first.

Slowly, the cup was coming into focus as the fragments arrived. It was a so-called red-figure kylix, a style in which the reddish figures are set against darkened backgrounds and have finer facial details — innovations that introduced greater realism to Greek art. Von Bothmer had already attributed it to Makron, a painter celebrated in particular for his depiction of women and their garments.

On the interior of the cup, a bearded man and a woman in partial dress recline on a couch at a symposium, or drinking revel. The woman, perhaps a prostitute, is shown flicking dregs of wine from a cup at a target in a game the Greeks called kottabos. On the cup’s exterior, older men pursue younger ones. One youth holds a cock, a love gift. Another holds a sponge for oils and a strigil, an instrument for scraping oil and sweat from the body.

The names of three men — Hippodamas, Eukrates and Euryptolemos — are inscribed on the outside, each followed by the word “kalos,” which means “is handsome” or “is beautiful.”

In 1994, some 16 years after the first fragments arrived, a final singular shard was given to the Met, again a gift from von Bothmer. He left no record of where he had gotten it, but at that point he carried out the final reconstruction that completed the cup.

“Dietrich turned what was a bunch of fragments into something that was beautiful,” said Hemingway, the Met curator.

Coincidence, Connoisseurship or Conspiracy?
It is not clear how the dozens of fragments that were used to reconstruct the kylix came to be so widely dispersed. But it is clear, investigators said, that three of the dealers who sold those fragments to the Met would be linked to the illegal trafficking of antiquities.

And all of them had some kind of relationship with von Bothmer.

Fritz Bürki, who sold the Met the first fragments in 1978, was an expert in the reassembly of fractured artifacts. He had rebuilt the infamous Euphronios krater for Hecht, the dealer who sold it to von Bothmer and the Met. In 2001, Bürki admitted knowing that many artifacts he restored had been looted and that he occasionally acted as a frontman for Hecht in the sale of such artifacts, according to court records.

The second set of kylix fragments came from Summa Gallery, a Los Angeles dealership in which Hecht had partnered with Bruce McNall, a colorful U.S. businessman. McNall, a former part owner of the Los Angeles Kings hockey team who once owned a Canadian Football League team with the actor John Candy and Wayne Gretzky, said in an interview that he could not remember the kylix fragments.

But he acknowledged that Hecht often purchased items from Medici, the dealer who had Polaroids that showed parts of the kylix. The photographs were found during a 1995 raid on Medici’s Geneva storeroom that turned up a hoard of looted artifacts and thousands of photographs of items that the authorities view as stolen.

“To my knowledge, everything was coming from wrong sources back then,” McNall said. No one in the art world, he said, showed particular concern, including curators who he said thought they were preserving for public display items that might otherwise disappear into private collections.

In an interview, Medici said he could not recall the kylix and disputed the contention that the Polaroids constituted evidence that the depicted fragments had passed through his hands. He said he was frequently sent photographs by other dealers.

McNall, who unlike Hecht was never accused of antiquities trafficking, said he did not knowingly participate in any organized scheme to sell the kylix in pieces to the Met. But he agreed that dealers would parcel out fragments over time, in part to ensure that prices would escalate as collectors or museums closed in on completing an object.

“The last pieces are so valuable,” he said.

The last of the fragments sold to the Met came in a 1988 purchase from Frieda Tchacos, a dealer who gave the Met a fragment for a second cup in 1990 to honor von Bothmer. Tchacos was arrested by Italian authorities in Cyprus in 2002 on charges of trafficking in looted art. She received an 18-month suspended sentence for handling smuggled goods.

Investigators with the Manhattan district attorney’s office said that, based on a witness account, they believe Tchacos, who could not be reached for comment, had gotten her kylix fragments from Raffaele Monticelli, a man U.S. and Italian authorities identified as a major tomb raider before his death last year.

Some of the dealers who sold fragments to the Met had not been charged with any crimes related to antiquities when their fragments came to the museum. But Bogdanos said an expert like von Bothmer “could not have not known that these objects were looted.”

In the late 1970s, concern in the museum world over looted objects did not burn as brightly as it does today. By the 1990s, though, when von Bothmer donated his last fragment to the reconstruction, museums had embraced stricter guidelines that frowned on the acquisition of ancient objects that lacked a back story.

“From the very first fragment, it was the responsibility of the Met to verify that they are not putting themselves in trouble,” especially after the outcry over the Euphronios krater, said Christos Tsirogiannis, a forensic archaeologist and head of illicit antiquities research at the Ionian University in Greece. “Instead, in this case they collected all these fragments out of thin air with a provenance that had no details” beyond the names of the immediate suppliers.

Von Bothmer, who died in 2009, had long denied being lax in his acquisition standards or cavalier in accepting the krater.

“A dog shouldn’t be treated the way they treated me,” he said in an interview in 1972.

In a statement, the Met said: “All acquisitions met the Museum’s standards at that time. As laws and guidelines on collecting have changed over time, so have The Met’s policies and procedures.”

The experts who dispute the theory that fragments are used to aid smuggling argue that shards could easily become dispersed at an archaeological dig if someone discovered a key shard first, paying less attention to other pieces that might have been farther away, and leaving them in the ground for others to find later in second or third digs.

Dealers, these experts said, are typically rivals unlikely to conspire with competitors, but capable of letting fragments become separated in the tumult of a busy workshop.

The seeming serendipity of their coming together in a museum can be explained by the strength of von Bothmer’s expertise, Padgett, the former Princeton curator, said.

“Bothmer had a good eye,” said Padgett, who called him “a man of deep principles.”

But Marlowe, the art historian from Colgate, said the remarkable reunification of long lost fragments suggested other forces may have been at work.

“There are tens of thousands of fragments out there,” she said. “I don’t care how big your contact book is, there is no way you are going to connect the dots unless you already have advance knowledge and notification to look out for, say, some guy’s left arm.”

At his death, von Bothmer bequeathed the Met some 16,000 fragments, some of which are on display today in one of the two galleries named for him at the museum.

Occupying a central spot in one of the galleries is a second cup by Makron and Hieron that von Bothmer also put together from fragments.

It, too, is remarkable, not just because of its craftwork or the careful way it was reconstructed. Like the kylix just returned to Italy, the pieces for this second cup came to the Met over time from the very same group as the first: Bürki, Tchacos, McNall’s gallery and von Bothmer himself, with an additional shard donated by Elizabeth Hecht, the tainted dealer’s wife.

Bogdanos said he was aware of the second cup, describing it as an artifact of interest but not one currently part of an investigation.

It is hard, though, he said, to embrace the notion that some museum curators were just blessed when it came to finding the pieces they needed.

“Of all of the millions upon millions of fragments in the world, of all of the thousands of museums, of all the gin joints in the world, all the fragments came into my place?” he said. “And that’s a coincidence?”

    "85" : """In her new memoir, Chita Rivera says she could never relate to the song “I’m Still Here,” Stephen Sondheim’s beloved ode to persevering despite the odds. She liked the song just fine, but, as a nose-to-the-grindstone professional, there was no time for nostalgia — she was always looking ahead to the next gig. Then the pandemic arrived and, “like the rest of the world, there I was.”

Even when the pandemic presented her with an occasion to hit pause, her urge to look back was borne out of a desire to pay it forward. “I really wanted a memoir that kids could read and apply themselves to,” Rivera, 90, said over tea last month at the Laurie Beechman Theater in Midtown Manhattan. “It’s not as much of a memoir as it is an opportunity for kids to realize that if they want this, they can have it — but they have to work hard.”

“Chita: A Memoir,” written with the journalist Patrick Pacheco and available on April 25, traces the three-time Tony Award winner’s life with a veteran’s clarity and insouciance. Over its 320 pages, the Puerto Rican-American performer, who was raised in Washington, D.C., fondly recalls her early dance classes, her move to New York City to study at George Balanchine’s School of American Ballet, her breakthrough as Anita in “West Side Story” and her continued success on Broadway (18 appearances total) and beyond.

Upon reflecting on all she learned from the likes of Balanchine, Jerome Robbins and Bob Fosse, Rivera, who had long been approached about writing a memoir, decided finally to tell her story. She’s no stranger to sharing her experiences and playing mentor. The actress Laura Benanti, with whom Rivera starred in the 2003 Broadway revival of “Nine,” said in a phone interview that Rivera’s generosity during the production was almost maternal.

“She makes you feel immediately part of a team,” Benanti said. “She’s not just out there for herself. She taught me that you’re only as good as the person you’re playing opposite, so you want everybody to thrive.”

The book also delves into Rivera’s fruitful collaborations with the composer John Kander and the lyricist Fred Ebb. Their “triumvirate,” as Kander described it over the phone, led to her Tony-nominated performances as the publicity-hungry murderess Velma Kelly in “Chicago”; Anna, the roller-skating rink owner who makes amends with her daughter, in “The Rink”; and Aurora, the object of a gay prisoner’s diva worship, in “Kiss of the Spider Woman.” She often joined the national or international tours of those productions, which deepened Rivera’s ties to her best-known roles.

Kander called her a composer’s blessing. “When you hear Chita, you see Chita. When you work with somebody like that, their range is so enormous that there’s nothing you can’t write,” he said of developing characters with Rivera. “It’s a spirit that I hear. If there’s a natural feeling when you imagine Chita singing it, then you’re on the right track.”

Rivera, with her sharp, sensuous agility, has been a regular stage presence, from her professional debut in 1952 as a featured dancer in the national tour of “Call Me Madam” to her final Broadway bow in 2015 for “The Visit,” another collaboration with Kander and Ebb (and their frequent book writer Terrence McNally). She’s never gone more than three years without a major, regional or touring production — even when raising her daughter with Tony Mordente, Lisa, though her birth did delay the London premiere of “West Side Story” — and she continues to perform her cabaret act. This constant work is all she knows, Rivera said, though it has left her with a slight blind spot when it comes to the business she so loves.

She first saw her friend Fosse’s 1978 revue, “Dancin’,” for example, when it was revived on Broadway this spring. “I didn’t have much time to see the shows,” she said. “That’s how the golden age was for me: one show after another, one fabulous lyricist after another fabulous composer, all growing up at the same time. It was great for me because I learned constantly.”

The “Dancin’” revival, directed by one of the original cast members, Wayne Cilento, reminded her of her heyday. “Because it’s full of fabulous dancers that work really hard, and that’s all they do, is dance.”

To help her revisit that time for the memoir, Rivera turned to Pacheco, whom she met in 1975 while he was writing about her nightclub act at the Grand Finale cabaret for the entertainment magazine After Dark. They also got together over cosmopolitans in 2005, when Pacheco interviewed her at length; his notes shaped McNally’s book for her solo Broadway show, “Chita Rivera: The Dancer’s Life.”

“He’s funny, he likes the spirit to be uplifted, and he found me amusing,” Rivera said. Pacheco later added that the two bonded over being Latino and Catholic — “a key to her personality,” he said. Interviews for the memoir began in the summer of 2020, from her home in Rockland County, N.Y., originally as informal conversations. They pitched it to publishers once a narrative structure came together.

“I don’t think she would have ever done it if Covid hadn’t come around,” Pacheco said, “because she is unstoppable when it comes to her career. That’s what she really lives for — to be on that stage.”

“She was less enthusiastic about revealing her private life,” Pacheco continued, noting her reluctance to discuss her romance with Sammy Davis Jr. “But she really was a good sport. Once we read a chapter together, she rarely asked for any changes. I would say, in 100,000 words if she asked me to delete 50, that would be major.”

Those seeking gossip might be disappointed, though. Aside from some light naughtiness when describing her love affairs and weakness for Italian men, the book’s juiciest disclosure might be that Rivera turned down the playwright Arthur Laurents’s request to star as Rose in the London premiere of “Gypsy” in the early 1960s.

In her 30s at the time, Rivera writes she felt she was too young, polite and distant from her inner “renegade” to play an overbearing stage mother. That renegade emerges in the book as her alter ego, Dolores. (Rivera was born Dolores Conchita Figueroa del Rivero Anderson.) Whereas Chita is the sweet one “who tries to bring everything together, solve problems and likes to laugh,” she said, Dolores doesn’t hold back, and gets her jobs. “She was the one that protected me,” she said. “Thanks to Patrick, we brought her out.”

These personas sit atop her shoulders, Rivera said, battling it out like a Boricua Jekyll and Hyde. When mulling over replacing her friend Gwen Verdon in the title role of “Sweet Charity” for its national tour, she remembered, “The two angels on my shoulders were saying, ‘You can’t.’ ‘Well, yes, you can — if you bring your own shoes.’”

It is Dolores who provides the bulk of the book’s snarky wit and shrugs off being passed over for film adaptations, though she originated the characters onstage. “They’re always winning Oscars for roles that I’ve done, but that’s cool,” Rivera said with a confident smirk, referring to a comment in the book about Rita Moreno’s and Catherine Zeta-Jones’s wins for “West Side Story” and “Chicago.”

“I feel that you can’t replace the person that originates a role,” she continued. “I say in my act: ‘Catherine, you keep your Oscar, I’ll keep my vamp.’ And it’s a great vamp. I would hold it as long as the first two rows would let me.”

She recalled the vamp — Kander’s introduction to “All That Jazz” from “Chicago,” a seductive eight-count that can be teased out forever — and how, when performing that signature number, she would glare at the audience and “just pulse.”

“Whenever you hear that vamp, you think of ‘Jazz,’” she said, tapping her fingers like a drumroll. “And who sang ‘Jazz’? I did.”

    "86" : """There’s probably no way, in a town as basketball crazy as Los Angeles, for a six-foot preteen Black boy to avoid unwanted attention. When the artist Mark Bradford turned 12 or so and shot up to nearly his current height — he stands at a gangly 6-foot-8, with a body reminiscent of Kevin Durant’s — he drew a scrutiny he wasn’t used to. Middle-school coaches would pressure him into playing basketball, but he found the sport’s aggressiveness unappealing. When he decided that the game wasn’t for him, those coaches reacted with a refrain that Bradford remembers to this day: “If I were you, I wouldn’t have wasted that gift.” It was the first of many times in Bradford’s life when his desires would fail to line up with how the world viewed him.

His mother’s hair salon was a more comfortable space than the basketball court: There he would customize clothing for his mother’s regulars, style wigs and, of course, learn to do women’s hair. Sometimes he would climb up into the salon’s windows and pose like a mannequin for unsuspecting passers-by. But by the time he hit puberty, other people began to register his queerness. “When kids go through puberty, they start to group up, and the group that I got associated with was the weaklings or the sissies,” he told me in late February, the first time we met in his Los Angeles studio, a massive hangar tucked away in a sprawling warehouse complex. “And that meant that you were also much more privy to violence.”

Disturbed by the social disarray that had befallen South Central — South Los Angeles, in today’s sanitized parlance — his mother moved Bradford, who was about 11, and his younger sister to the Westside beach town of Santa Monica in the early ’70s. But a tonier environment did not equal greater comfort. No matter where he lived, he was too noticeable. When he walked the streets, people would lean out of cars to call him a punk or hurl racial slurs at him. “When I would leave the apartment,” he remembered, “I would walk to the right but not to the left, because I knew there were people two blocks down that would be a little more tough on me.” Navigating the city meant navigating other people’s assumptions about what, and who, he could be.

Outside Bradford’s Los Angeles studio, yet another winter storm was blitzing the city, and the rainfall beat an endless patter on the roof. Together we ambled through the space. The tall, white walls were covered in reference photos, artifacts that served as inspirations for his latest show, “You Don’t Have to Tell Me Twice,” which opened this month at Hauser & Wirth in New York. There were covers of novels like Cormac McCarthy’s “Blood Meridian”; a map of William Faulkner’s fictional Yoknapatawpha County; stills from ballroom drag performances; a photo of a plaque commemorating Blackdom, a homesteader colony in New Mexico where Black farmers settled around 1909. The show uses these artifacts to probe how American fantasies — like Manifest Destiny — enable certain kinds of racist and homophobic violence. The work in the studio felt like Bradford’s attempt to marry the historical to the personal and to probe the ways in which a man who grew up feeling deeply unsafe might survive.

As he recounted his childhood, Bradford, who is now 61, was equally pensive and chatty. Because he is one of the nation’s most visible artists — he was awarded a MacArthur fellowship in 2009, and his art has been acquired by institutions like the Museum of Modern Art and the Tate Modern and collected by the likes of Eli Broad — he spoke to me about his personal story with the silver-tongued eloquence of someone who has figured out how to publicly discuss his life without giving much away. Dressed in a white camo puffer jacket, he often paused theatrically, raising his face to the ceiling, putting a finger to his chin or folding his arms as he lapsed into thought. Occasionally he acted out his memories, pantomiming with a vaudeville comedian’s elastic physicality; sometimes he circled me while he spoke, so that I had to turn around and around if I wanted to maintain eye contact.

When you’re looking at a Bradford canvas, part of what you’re seeing is the perspective of someone who has learned in both his life and work to dance in the gulf between what society expects him to be and the fact of his interiority. It’s like bullfighting: a matter of learning how to court and withstand the world’s attention in ways that won’t get you gored, how to inhabit one’s subjectivity in ways that don’t confuse the shadow for the act. “It is very difficult. I will always grapple with being in this body,” he told me. “As an extremely tall Black man, a queer man, all this stuff walks into the room. And then here comes Mark, trotting in. Sometimes Mark is more present than those other parts. Sometimes those other parts are more present than Mark.”

One way that Bradford has negotiated these potentially suffocating perceptions is by embracing a certain kind of abstraction. Typically, his art resists figuration — broadly speaking, work that represents the human form through techniques like portraiture and sculpture — in favor of impressionistic amalgams of everything from comic-book panels to maps to salvaged billboard ads. “One of the ideas that I’m really interested in promoting is that we, like any other people, can and should be allowed to be private and not have to explain our stories through figuration,” he said in an interview with Anita Hill that appeared in his 2018 namesake monograph. “We should have the right to be abstract. Why not?”

This insistence on abstraction is a self-protective gesture that also has a political valence. Each painting is an attempt to figure out how to explore the personal, social and historical elements of his experience without being waylaid by other people’s assumptions — about what it means to be a gay Black man who lived through the crack and AIDS epidemics in Los Angeles, for instance. To that end, Bradford’s paintings are flirtations, seductions, an assertion of his right to hold something in reserve even as he invites his audience to participate in a conversation. Each painting is posing a question: What of himself will Bradford offer up this time? The answer will vary, but the very question is an assertion of political will.

While the nation’s evolving understanding of American racial politics has raised a multigenerational and stylistically diverse set of figurative artists to heightened prominence (think of Kerry James Marshall, Kehinde Wiley, Amy Sherald or Jennifer Packer), Bradford’s success as an abstract painter has been premised on something of a stiff-arm. Rather than foreground his body for audiences to consume and contemplate, his paintings submerge viewers in that body’s perspective: You don’t see him, but you see through his eyes. In doing so, his canvases confound rote narratives and, depending on who’s doing the looking, quiver with feeling. The painter and sculptor Henry Taylor, a friend of Bradford’s — the two attended the California Institute of the Arts together in the ’90s — likened his paintings to the music of the jazz greats. “It’s like Coltrane,” he told me over the phone. “He’s not telling me nothing. You got to hear it, and you got to feel it.” Bradford’s paintings duck and feint with a boxer’s evasive eloquence, playing a game of hide-and-seek that produces a charged emotional resonance. Looking at his canvases, for me, produces a feeling like the disorientation of waking up from a dream in which the familiar — the landscape of Black Los Angeles, Black masculinity, the history of capitalist exploitation, environmental catastrophe, racial violence — had been pushed to the very edge of legibility, made uncanny.

So when the artist and I walked into the studio’s back reaches, I was startled to find photos of a younger Bradford taped to the walls — behind-the-scenes footage from Super 8 films that he made with childhood friends. In one photo, he and a few playmates use a bathtub to stand in for an airport runway. In another, a 12-year-old Bradford — the boy who was getting slurs and bottles hurled at him in Santa Monica — is dressed in a red puffer jacket, twisting his upper body and arching his back as if at the start of an exaggerated fall. In the home movie that still is pulled from, Bradford pretended to die after being shot. In the middle of the room sat a cutout of an adult Bradford, posed like his 12-year-old self, arms splayed out, his right leg twisted beneath him.

This was preparation for a life-size sculpture of the artist himself, which appears in the new show — an autobiographical piece that is direct and personal in ways that Bradford has rarely attempted in his career. Standing there, I realized that I was witnessing a high-wire act: an artist who has used abstraction to resist representation’s strictures wrestling with a new way of telling his story.

No matter where an artist falls on the spectrum between figurative and abstract painting, Black art has always tried to straddle the gap between the two rather than choosing a side. Look at the way Barack Obama leans forward with his arms crossed in Kehinde Wiley’s 2018 presidential portrait, conveying a sense of guardedness. He’s present but not fully there, a tension Wiley heightens by having the chair that Obama is sitting in levitate. There’s a suggestion of a certain something more that the eye cannot process. In this way, Black art endeavors to answer the question: How do you tell a story without telling on yourself?

Over the course of his career, Bradford has tried to answer that question by borrowing and unsettling the principles of Abstract Expressionists like Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko. As the conceptual artist Charles Gaines, who taught and mentored Bradford when he was a student at CalArts in the ’90s, explained to me, Bradford’s art rejects the Abstract Expressionist idea that art can be reduced to the media — the canvas, the paint, the found objects — that give it form. “Those guys, if they see ripples in a lake, they’ll tell you that they’re caused by the physics of someone’s hands moving back and forth,” he told me, “not by a person drowning.”

Bradford charges the reverence for form and materials with a sense of life as it’s lived in South Central. “At the end of the day, I’m an abstract artist. But the question I’m proposing is: If you’re pulling from source material that lives in the world, is it ever truly abstract?” Bradford asked in the studio. “The answer, I would say, is no. Race, gender and class will always cling to the material.”

You can’t look at his early paintings, made from endpapers used to perm hair, and not consider the social life they emerge from — a young Bradford standing in the window of his mother’s salon. Take 2002’s “Strawberry,” where he singed, dyed and arranged endpapers to form roughly articulated, unstable rectangles that referred to and upended the history of the modernist grid. Visually, though, they recalled an aerial view of a chaotic urban landscape, all color and movement; paired with its title (a slang term for a person who exchanges sex for money to buy drugs), the painting gestured toward the social and emotional meanings that suffused Bradford’s constructions.

He experimented with other ways of playing with social history, too. In 2003, he made the video short “Practice,” which talks back to all the coaches who wanted him to play basketball by giving them what they wanted, taunting them a little in the process. Alone on a court, he’s hooping while decked out in the Lakers’ storied purple and gold — except the colors grace a goofy skirt that makes it nearly impossible for him to score a basket. His celebrated merchant posters, made from local advertisements that he salvages from his neighborhood and then effaces so that multiple layers surface simultaneously, tell a history of predation via something as commonplace as payday-loan advertisements. In 2008, he completed “Mithra,” a huge tongue-in-cheek Noah’s Ark created from plywood panels, which he erected in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. His 2015 show “Scorched Earth,” at the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, began with an installation made by excavating over 100 layers of paint in the museum’s lobby wall, as if in search of something previously hidden. The excavation yielded a map of the United States, with data on each state’s population of AIDS patients circa 2009, etched into the wall. These pieces acknowledge the fact of someone drowning in the lake — or the community flailing in the wake of managed decline. Like Bradford, the work is both forthcoming and circumspect, effervescent and haunted, alternately playful and possessed of a deep moral seriousness.

The clearest precedent for this work might be the experimental assemblages of 1960s and ’70s Black Los Angeles. Noah Purifoy and Judson Powell’s 1966 group show, “66 Signs of Neon,” turned the wreckage of the Watts riots — drippings from melted neon signs, for example — into art that gestured simultaneously at the anger that instigated the riots and a sense that the neighborhood itself was a work of art, if you looked in the right way. Their friend John Outterbridge, inspired by both Southern California and his childhood in North Carolina, used fabric, cloth and found objects to construct absurdist portraits, as in his “Rag Man” series. Betye Saar turned domestic items and racial kitsch — a figurine depicting Aunt Jemima, for example — into art that recalled and revised the history of enslavement.

This was all happening practically in Bradford’s backyard, but it wasn’t something he was tuned into. Though his mother encouraged his creativity, he didn’t connect that to fine art. “ ‘Creative’ was just a state of being,” he explained. “It wasn’t a means to an end.” He made friends with other kids in his Santa Monica apartment building, putting together a small community. Inspired by the blaxploitation films that stormed the movie industry in the 1970s, he shot his own Super 8 adaptations with friends. While the genre flooded theaters with images of hypermasculine, hypersexed and hyperstraight men — “Shaft” or “Super Fly”’ — Bradford wasn’t much interested in them. Instead, characters like Foxy Brown, Black women who muscled their way into the spotlight by any means necessary, caught his attention. “I kind of related to it because I was like, well, I don’t think I’m going to be able to be the main character, but I really do like Pam Grier,” he said. The salon and the apartment became spaces in which he learned that if he was going to survive the world, he would have to imagine other ways of living within it. “I was lucky. I was able to create these spaces where I could be the subject. I wasn’t ridiculed. I wasn’t beat up. I wasn’t a punk. I wasn’t a tall man who didn’t want to play basketball, who was a failure. I was Mark, doing his thing.”

The outside world didn’t reward that creativity. Bradford struggled through school, eventually winding up at a continuation high school. He drew on Willy Wonka to explain the experience: If other students seemed as though they had all gotten golden tickets, Bradford felt as though he had been designated for something lesser. “I was just getting ready to get handed a chocolate bar. There wasn’t no golden ticket. I was getting ready to be thrown away,” he told me. “I was just sensitive and tall and skinny and weird.”

While he was still a teenager, he found safety in Los Angeles’s discos, hubs of queer nightlife like Jewel’s Catch One in Arlington Heights that were spaces of play and imagination. But the onset of AIDS tore that world apart. “There were no cures. No help. No language around it. And you were shamed, and everybody was scared. So you just died. Everybody died.” Amid the simultaneous rise of the crack-cocaine epidemic and intensifying street violence, he felt his life was going to be extinguished. Faced with what seemed like certain death, he fled to Europe as a matter of survival. “I just did not think I was going to make it to 30. Everybody was in agreement that I was not going to make it to 30.”

Bradford eventually found his way into an arts program at Santa Monica College, which gave him studio space to begin making paintings; those paintings earned him entrance into CalArts, where he began his studies at age 30. After a series of fitful stops and starts, Bradford was invited by Thelma Golden, then the assistant director and head curator of the Studio Museum, to contribute work to her 2001 “Freestyle” show, where he exhibited with future luminaries like Julie Mehretu and Sanford Biggers.

With his endpaper paintings, Bradford demonstrated a talent for transmogrifying everyday objects by layering, sanding, gouging, scraping and tearing until they obliquely reflected his peculiar perspective on the world. He described his paintings as a result of wrestling with the personal, social and political history at hand. “The source material comes from the world, and that’s what I like,” he told me. “I drag it into the studio, and I beat it into some form of beauty, because that’s me demanding that even though the world is a violent place, and I don’t turn away from the violence, there’s also a magic and an alchemy that can happen.”

Bradford’s new work emerged from the darkness of pandemic-era isolation, which he found reminiscent of both the AIDS crisis and the violence that threatened him in adolescence. As when he was a teenager, he turned to real and imagined sites of fantasy: Blackdom, where Black homesteaders imagined a life of independence and safety; Faulkner’s Yoknapatawpha County; and the imagined North that displaced Black people thought might provide some relief from persecution. “I was fascinated by these loaded sites that were not real, but were real. The work came out of these imaginary spaces that had history, and it reminded me a lot of when I was a kid creating these imaginary sites for myself.” The Black vernacular phrase from which “You Don’t Have to Tell Me Twice” takes its name is a verb, he says — an assertion of the right to take one’s leave from participation in your own oppression. The show demonstrates again and again how this assertion evolves alongside increasingly complex versions of exploitation.

In a back room of Bradford’s studio hung colossal canvases, gray and black paintings that resembled rusted signage. They were recreations of railroad distance charts that Bradford, inspired by the migrations of Southern Black people to the North in the early and mid-20th century, began making a year or so ago. While those paintings gesture at heroic narratives of Black perseverance, a new piece, “Manifest Destiny” (initially titled “Johnny Buys Houses”), calls to mind the predatory financial practices that have plagued Black people in cities like Los Angeles. (The provisional title refers to investment groups that have swept into South Los Angeles communities to buy distressed properties in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.) The colorful and thickly layered “tapestry paintings,” some of which he first completed and showed in 2021, conjure a chaotic and lush jungle landscape stalked by Johnny the Jaguar, an apex predator in search of its prey. They recall the late-15th-century Northern European Unicorn Tapestries, which depicted French noblemen hunting and killing a unicorn in an idealized version of the French countryside. The result is a subtle set of works that tells a loose story about an otherworldly being — call it Johnny — who shape-shifts across time and space like a villain in a high-concept comic-book multiverse, chasing its equally wily prey.

But while those works reiterate and fine-tune ideas Bradford has been honing his entire career, “Death Drop, 2023” — the life-size sculpture whose preparations I saw at his Los Angeles studio back in February — is a disconcerting departure for an artist whose work has rarely featured his own likeness and often eschewed explicit autobiography. It is Bradford’s first foray into figurative sculpture in nearly two decades, a work of raw emotion that confronts the fact of violence and Bradford’s own vulnerability in the face of it. As he spoke of his plans for the show — he wanted this statue in the same room as the distance-chart paintings — Bradford described the whole endeavor to me as a sly tweaking of heroic civil rights narratives that sometimes erase the lives of queer Black people; in a follow-up text, he toyed with the idea of calling it “Drop Dead” as a provocation to those who would read it too literally. Over the course of our conversation, though, it became clear that the pandemic had created an echo between the violence of his formative years and the contemporary moment, an echo that Bradford was still straining to hear. It wasn’t a coincidence that the sculpture was based on footage of his 12-year-old self, an age he likened to Little Red Riding Hood’s being harassed by wolves. During our studio visit, Bradford turned uncharacteristically tongue-tied when he tried to articulate the sculpture’s relationship to that period.

“I’ve always run from death,” he said. “I heard so much about death all through the ’80s. ‘You’re going to die.’ ‘People are dying.’ ‘Let’s take another test.’” The realization of what he had conjured — an exploration not just of Black migration in search of safety but of his own flights, whether to his mother’s apartment or Europe, from the very real threat of death — stopped him short. “To put my body, dying, brings back … ” he trailed off. “What I ran from.” In his own way, it seemed, Bradford was looking for an oblique approach to making work about this in public — a way that felt safe even as he bared a bit more of his mind.

By March, the basic sculpture was complete. Bradford texted me photos of himself painting it in black acrylic paint, staring into his own eyes as he wielded a brush. It appeared so lifelike that the effect was unsettling, as if I were looking at Bradford look at his own death mask.

By the time I saw the statue at Hauser & Wirth’s gallery in Manhattan, though, it had been covered in billboard paper, the painted side facing down so that the statue was a splotchy white. One of Bradford’s studio assistants applied water with a brush, pointing out how each wash allowed the paint on the underside of the paper to seep through. In my head, I compared it with the pictures Bradford had texted. The billboard paper had somewhat dulled the sculpture’s expressiveness by obscuring its features. While its face had once seemed overwhelmingly vulnerable, it now looked like a stoic Greek artifact. Bradford likened it to the Elgin Marbles, assorted fragments of Greek sculpture that were essentially looted and taken to London. The fragments didn’t give all of the story, Bradford said; they made you do a bit of work to figure out what the story was. It seemed a typically Bradford-esque flirtation: hiding something that he would reveal, but only reluctantly, only after a bit of foreplay, and even then not entirely.

We wandered downstairs to the room where the Super 8 footage — Bradford had titled it “Death Drop, 1973” — played on a loop. Rather than have the footage and the sculpture in the same room, Bradford decided to separate the two in an attempt to make the show less literal. Curious about the decision, I asked him whether he thought of his work as a way to hide out in plain sight. He concurred.

“I have the right to go to a racially charged site and decide how much I’m going to give you,” he said. “And how much I’m going to keep for myself.” In the background, the young Bradford tossed his long arms into the air, fell backward and turned his head, staring directly into the camera.

    "87" : """When Diane Ladd is diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and given six months to live, her daughter Laura Dern looks at her and thinks, “You can’t die.” Determined to increase her mother’s lung capacity and life span, Dern gets the doctor’s permission to take Ladd on daily 15-minute walks, distracting her mother by asking questions about the past.

Transcripts of those conversations are the beating heart of “Honey, Baby, Mine,” the actresses’ joint memoir, which also includes photographs, recipes, memorabilia and short, interspersed chapters written by each woman.

They commiserate over the timeless frustrations of their industry, while also reflecting on what has slowly changed. Dern recalls visiting her mom’s sets as a child, catching the acting bug when Martin Scorsese asked her to appear as an extra in “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore.” Allowing a child on the set was still frowned upon nearly two decades later, when they worked together on “Rambling Rose” (for which they became the only mother-daughter pair ever to have been nominated for Academy Awards for the same film) ‌and had to advocate for their director to be allowed to nurse her baby at work.

By the time Dern co-starred in the 2017 TV mini-series “Big Little Lies,” actors’ children were so commonly present that, she writes, “we had effectively created a … day care.”

Along the way, they toss about glittery names, among them Tennessee Williams, Norman Mailer, Shelley Winters, Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon (who also provides the foreword).  If you’re in it for the stargazing, you’ll be rewarded with plenty — but that’s not what lingers most after the telling.

As actors, Dern and Ladd have spent decades peeling back layers to reveal their characters’ fears and desires. It’s when they turn that focus to each other and themselves that something remarkable emerges.

At first it seems a bit repetitive. Mother and daughter reminisce, joke and bicker, circling back to the same topics: the craft of acting, the strange experience of fame, the infinite doubts and compromises of motherhood.

On one walk-and-talk, they tell funny anecdotes about Ladd’s mother, “Grandma Mary,” a wisecracking Mississippi divorcée who assisted with Dern’s upbringing after Ladd divorced Dern’s father, the actor Bruce Dern. Mary defied her era’s Southern Belle stereotypes, rejecting racism and classism in favor of everyday advocacy for equality. Her daughter and granddaughter learned a lot about independence from her, they agree.

Then the tone shifts. On a later walk, Dern admits that she often resented being left with her grandmother while Ladd was away for work. A suddenly emotional Ladd says she sometimes felt unfairly burdened with the responsibility of supporting not only her daughter but her mother, “working 12-hour days making the money to pay the rent, buy her clothes, put food in her mouth for her to go get entertained and travel and play with you.”

Emboldened by each day’s revelations and driven by their abiding love for each other, they wade into deeper confessions. The book is at its most memorable and affecting when they work up the courage to excavate heavy, sharp-edged emotional artifacts.

Neither has forgotten the time Ladd slapped a teenage Dern in the kitchen of their home, though each remembers the moment differently. They reopen a bitter argument about the time Ladd took Dern’s young son for a significant haircut without her permission; neither party is ready to back down, still. They revisit the time Dern, racked with grief over her divorce from the musician Ben Harper, yelled, “You have no idea what I’m feeling right now!” and upended a sofa — and how her mother responded by making tea and reminding her that her scoliosis made it unwise to lift such heavy things.

Eventually they confront Ladd’s greatest pain, a nearly unendurable loss she experienced as a young mother.

They yell, grow quiet, accuse and forgive, allowing us to witness their relationship evolving, walk by walk. Ladd’s health improves. Dern draws even closer to her mother. For them, the experiment proves successful. For readers, it may depend on what we come for. I recommend going into “Honey, Baby, Mine” curious about the origin stories, separate and intertwined, of two prolific artists who pushed through private challenges — are pushing through still — while forging lives in the public eye.

    "88" : """Season 3, Episode 6: ‘Sunflowers’
This was for me an odd and largely dissatisfying episode in addition to being, at over an hour, the longest episode to date. It felt an awful lot like the “bottle episodes” added to the run late last season: “Carol of the Bells” (which I rather liked) and “Beard After Hours” (which I did not). It is not, however, a bottle episode, as two characters’ story lines move notably forward; it’s just an episode that, apart from those characters, goes essentially nowhere. And did I mention it was really long?

The team is visiting Amsterdam for a “friendly”(an exhibition match) against the Dutch team AFC Ajax. They lose 5-0, but this blowout is quickly forgotten. The team’s dejection leads Ted to declare that there will be no curfew in this city of vice — a more accurate episode title would have been “Everyone After Hours.”

In any case, let me start with the story lines I thought were dull or unnecessary and then reward your patience with the ones that were actually moving and/or interesting.

The team (minus Colin and Jamie)
What will the team do, set free in this world capital of legalized drugs and prostitution? Van Damme (formerly known as Zoreaux) proposes, plausibly enough for a pro athlete let loose in Amsterdam, that the team attend a sex show. Jan Maas, back in his home country, recommends an all-night party where his cousin is DJ-ing, located two hours away. (Dani suggests the team look for a single tulip but finds no takers).

The sensible route, as Dani notes, would be for the players to split up and seek their pleasures wherever they wish. But Isaac, the team captain, demands that they all do something together, and from that moment it’s clear that there will be an exceptionally silly resolution to the dilemma. Although they finally choose to make the trip to Jan’s cousin’s party, they immediately fall into a subsidiary argument about where to get food beforehand.

So, of course, it winds up that they go nowhere and instead have a pillow fight at the hotel. If I’d made a list of 10 possible lame conclusions for this story line, “pillow fight” probably would have been worse than any of them. C’mon, “Ted Lasso.” You’re better than this.

Higgins (and Will)
Shortly after the match, Higgins announces that he can’t go out with Rebecca and Keeley because, “I have a date with someone special in the Red Light District.” Later, after inviting Will the kit boy to join him, he announces, “Tonight’s the night young William becomes a man.”

Scandalous! Higgins, who seemed so happily married with five boys at home, is going to the sex hub of Amsterdam — and he’s taking young Will with him!

Except, of course, anyone who’s watched more than 10 minutes of “Ted Lasso” knows perfectly well that this is a red herring, and that Higgins will have some perfectly innocent reason for visiting this zone of iniquity. Moreover, as with the joint team activity, it seems likely that the faux-surprise will be silly, bordering on annoying.

And indeed it is. The “someone special” whom Higgins drags Will to see is jazz legend Chet Baker — or rather, a plaque commemorating the spot where he fell out a window to his death in 1988.

As for making young William “a man,” Higgins means that he will introduce him to jazz, a meaning that I suspect has never before been imputed to that phrase in human history. Later, Higgins himself ascends to the stage of the jazz club they visit and is delighted to play Baker’s “Let’s Get Lost” on standing bass with the band.

Cute? Sure. And if Higgins’s previously (if briefly) glimpsed love of jazz were a significant theme of the show, it might have been a charming scene. But mostly it all felt like many more minutes spent for very little payoff.

Jamie and Roy
This subplot is a bit better, in large part because the evolution of Jamie, however quick and improbable — his namesake on “Game of Thrones” took seasons to achieve the self-improvement Tartt has accomplished in mere episodes — is pretty enjoyable.

But what is it with “Ted Lasso” and bikes? Last season, Dr. Sharon was run over by a car while cycling, which itself seemed to be an inside joke on the fact that the actress who plays Sharon, Sarah Niles, didn’t know how to ride a bike when she got the “Lasso” gig.

Now it’s Roy who is lacking in basic bicycle skills, because the grandfather who was going to teach him died before he had the chance. So it falls upon Jamie to teach him, so they can go out in search of a genuine Dutch windmill.

Like the Higgins story line, it’s modestly charming, and in this case has the advantage of being part of the ongoing Roy-Jamie subplot. But it’s still an awful lot of time spent to move that story forward only incrementally.

That said, there are a few amusing moments along the way. When Jamie reveals that his degenerate father brought him to Amsterdam to lose his virginity at 14 and Roy notes, “That must have been traumatizing,” Jamie’s response is priceless: “No, she loved it.” Pause. “Oh, it’s me you mean.”

And we see Good Jamie at his best when Roy, clearly upset all day, reveals “I think Keeley’s got a girlfriend.” Jamie does not take the bait, replying only, “Hmm. Let’s go find us some windmills, eh?”

Relatedly, the scene earlier in the episode, when Roy learned of Keeley’s trip to Norway with Jack to see the Aurora Borealis, led to one of the best exchanges of the episode. Roy: “Where’s she going?” Rebecca: “Somewhere that believes they deserve her.” I tire of saying this, but the show was simply better when Roy and Keeley were together. Please fix this before it’s too late, “Ted Lasso.”

Coach Beard unsurprisingly follows the motto, “When in Amsterdam, do as the Amsterdammers do.” And so he makes cups of hallucinogenic tea for him and Ted. Beard drains his quickly and heads out for what we can assume is another chapter of “Beard After Hours” — we are only privy to the postscript, when he shows up for the team bus as “Piggy Stardust.”

Ted, on the other hand, is understandably conflicted. He’s uncertain about the drugs, and he already despises tea. But he nonetheless ultimately gives it a shot, following which he heads out to the Van Gogh museum, where a docent provides Ted with what can only be described as a series of Lassoisms — i.e., “When you know you’re doing what you’re meant to do, you have to try.” Is this a hint about Ted’s complete failure to learn anything much at all about coaching soccer (a failure many commenters here have pointed out)?

The next scene suggests it may be. Ted, having had his fill of foreignness, heads to the Yankee Doodle Burger Barn restaurant, which advertises American food in American portions. (For those who didn’t make the connection, the barbecue sauce the waitress brings him is from Arthur Bryant’s, Ted’s favorite joint in Kansas City.) Faced with a pyramid of onion rings, he begins thinking about triangles. Coincidentally, an old Jordan-era Bulls game is on the television, featuring the triangle offense implemented by the coach Phil Jackson.

I initially thought that this was merely a callback to the John Wooden “Pyramid of Success” that Ted has hanging on his wall, and at which he gave a meaningful look late in the last episode. Instead, after a rather tedious hallucination in which he believes himself to be speaking to the True Spirit of Adventure (Disney voice actor Corey Burton), Ted begins formulating a variation on the triangle offense suitable for soccer, utilizing ketchup and mustard squeeze bottles.

It all leads to two late exchanges with Coach Beard. The first is the revelation that Beard’s drugs were duds: Ted wasn’t high at all! I’m not sure how precisely we are meant to take this. Ted’s hallucination was rather a lot to be a placebo effect, and the only alternative would be that he is clinically mentally ill. It’s another element of the episode that would have been better left on the cutting-room floor.

The second interaction is better: Coach Beard, impressed by the fact that Ted has come up with a game strategy for perhaps the first time in the series, recommends the term “Total Football,” before explaining that the concept was in fact invented right there in Holland back in the 1970s. But as the Van Gogh docent recommended, they will give it a try.

Colin
At last, a story line with some genuine emotional impact. Colin, feigning a stomach ache, sneaks away from the team to head to a gay bar. But he is followed by Trent Crimm. Colin is horrified, but Trent reassures him: “I’ve known for months. I haven’t said anything to anyone. I must have a good reason for that, mustn’t I?”

The reason, of course — and I know I’ve been writing “of course” a lot, but it’s that kind of episode — is that Trent himself is gay and out to both his wife and daughter. Which is all well and good, but seems unnecessary. How about letting his “good reason” for not outing Colin be merely that he is a decent human being? Memo to the “Ted Lasso” writers: You don’t need to be gay to want not to potentially ruin a gay person’s life.

The scene is redeemed, however, by Billy Harris, who plays Colin. “I don’t want to be a spokesperson; I don’t want a bunch of apologies,” he explains. “All I want is for, when we win a match, to be able to kiss my fella the same way the other guys get to kiss their girls.”

Rebecca
I have saved the best for last, a subplot strong enough that it almost justifies the whole episode. Rebecca, alone in Amsterdam after her abandonment by Higgins and Keeley, is nearly run over by a bicyclist while standing on a bridge and falls head over heels into a canal. It appears that this is what the psychic predicted back in Episode 3: “You’re upside down, and you’re drenched.” There is, however, no “thunder and lightning” — unless that is a metaphor for what happens next.

A nearby houseboat resident, kind and endearing, helps her dry her clothes and offers her the use of his shower. (The character, as yet unnamed, is played by the prolific Dutch actor Matteo van der Grijn.) He makes her tea and later dinner, and Rebecca gradually sheds the emotional armor in which she encased herself following dates with jerks such as John Wingsnight.

It’s not easy at first, as each shows signs of sexual paranoia sheathed in jokes: Is the tea drugged? Could there be a peephole into the shower? Are the women’s clothes he has in his closet “trophies”? Happily, the answers are no, no and no.

As she did last episode, Hannah Waddingham does marvelous work. You can almost hear the tension gradually leaving her body. Dinner, which had been a “no,” becomes a yes. Likewise, the invitation to a drink (or several), and ultimately a foot massage. (Shades of “Pulp Fiction”: As Vincent Vega would explain, “There’s a sensuous thing going on.”)

The next morning, Rebecca asks this nameless charmer, “Did we?” He answers, accurately, that they did not. (We saw him pull a blanket over her after she fell asleep during the foot massage and then retire to his bedroom.) But after she departs with a rather significant kiss, he asks himself the same question, and answers “Oh yes, we did.”

That’s because he’s asking himself a different question. Something happened between them. It was not sex; rather, it was more important than sex — a genuine connection of kindred spirits. I mean how often do two people find themselves sharing a bilingual duet of Kenny Rogers’s “She Believes in Me”? It is, as he keeps noting, “Gezelligheid.”

I found this truly lovely. TV and film typically operate on the premise that a romance is not real unless it is consummated in bed. It’s heartening to see a show recognize that that is not the case. Oh, and did I mention that Rebecca, post-shower, looked into what was clearly the bedroom of a young girl and beamed with delight?

I don’t know where this story line is headed. Will Rebecca learn her quasi-paramour’s name and track him back down to make the “family” the psychic promised her? Or will the house-boater merely have served the purpose of proving to her that she can take the armor off, that she is still able to love and be loved? Given that I found the scenes between the two of them to be perhaps the best of the entire season, I am strongly rooting for the former. And let us not forget that Sassy shared a premonition with Rebecca — a warmth in the belly — right before Rebecca tumbled.

Two enjoyable moments with the Dutch reporter after the blowout match: Jan responding (in Dutch), “Luckily our spirits were already broken,” and Roy deriding every element of the proceedings, including the reporter, as “pretend.”

A nice little joke with the Zava poster in the Ajax stadium, which shows him characteristically to have played with the team from 2013 to … later in 2013.

Ted is pretty quick to interpret Coach Beard’s “Pineapple Percussions” to be “doldrums.” And one has to like him name-checking “Hill Street Blues” as the inspiration for his “Let’s be careful out there.”

You have to love the use of “Raindrops Keep Fallin’ on My Head” as Roy is learning to ride a bike, especially if you remember the scene from “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” that it was written for.

    "89" : """Tobias Rahim, a 6-foot-7 Kurdish Danish pop singer, strode around the vast stage of Copenhagen’s Royal Arena one recent Saturday night dressed in a tasseled gold cowboy outfit.

He was midway through “Stor Mand” (“Big Man”), a romantic duet sung with Andreas Odbjerg, another star in Denmark. But it seemed like Rahim barely needed to perform: He simply pointed his microphone at the 16,000-capacity crowd who manically sung every word for him.

Soon, the crowd — some wearing cowboy hats just like Rahim — made their adoration even clearer, when a group started chanting, “The girls want your body.” The quirky 33-year-old, who posed nude for a previous project, quickly moved onto the next hit.

In recent years, American music fans have become accustomed to listening to pop in languages other than English. K-pop groups and Spanish-language acts like Bad Bunny have had hits on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart, and French-language singers have been appearing at major festivals in the United States.

Danish, an often staccato language spoken by only about six million people and whose alphabet includes the letters Æ, Ø and Å, is perhaps an unlikely choice for pop’s next lingua franca. But Rahim said in an interview the day after the show that there was no reason Danish-language pop couldn’t take off, too.

Outside the country, Denmark has long been renowned for its gastronomy and noirish television dramas. Rahim said there was equal talent in its pop scene. “The energy field here is really strong,” he said. Rahim had heard criticism that Danish was an ugly language, but he said he disagreed: “Any language converted into music can be super beautiful.”

A handful of Danish musicians, including the fresh-faced Lukas Graham and the arty singer MØ, have long made music in English to cultivate audiences abroad. Simon Lund, the music editor of Politiken, a major Danish newspaper, said in an interview that the country was still producing great English-language songs, but that it was also seeing a boom in Danish-language pop, with acts showcasing catchy melodies.

Among those, Lund said, Rahim was the phenomenon. Last year, tracks from his second album, “Nar sjælen kaster op” (“When the Soul Vomits”), topped Denmark’s singles charts for nearly 40 weeks. “Når Mænd Græder” (“When Men Cry”), a track about how men should be able to be emotional, set off a national debate about the nature of masculinity, Lund added.

In the run-up to Christmas, Rahim released a poetry collection that included a picture of him nude, clenching a rose in his mouth. The book sold out in stores and now, the singer is “impossible to ignore” in Denmark, Lund said.

Growing up half-Kurdish and half-Danish in the coastal city of Aarhus, Rahim said he never felt like he fully belonged and often felt “half.” The nude photographs, he added, showed him as a proud, and whole, mixed-race “neo-Scandinavian man.”

Throughout his career, Rahim has tried to find success outside Denmark.

In 2009, shortly after leaving school, he moved to Cali, Colombia, where he became friends with rappers and reggaeton musicians who lived in one of that city’s more impoverished neighborhoods. Rahim said he spent about two years making music there and left only after witnessing a neighbor get shot.

In Denmark, he released a handful of tracks as part of the reggaeton duo Camilo & Grande, but in 2018, he got the urge to move again, this time heading to Accra, Ghana, where he performed as an Afropop artist under the name Toby Tabu. In Ghana, Rahim said he sought to act like any other local musician, hustling to get his upbeat songs played on the radio, performing support slots for big local names and sleeping on couches while he tried to break through.

Despite those attention-grabbing travels, his career only truly took off in Denmark with the 2022 album “When the Soul Vomits,” written with the producer Arto Eriksen and filled with ’80s influenced pop songs and personal songwriting. Rahim said he used to be afraid of being vulnerable in his music, fearing that producers would tell him to stick to “sexy reggaeton,” but at the height of the coronavirus pandemic he forced himself to overcome such doubts. Soon, he was working on tracks about his Kurdish heritage and his father’s emotional distance.

So far, becoming a pop phenomenon — even in a small country like Denmark — has been a mixed experience. Rahim said that last year he often felt like he was on a runaway train, and that he started having delusions “that someone was going to kill me.”

In the fall, while rehearsing for a performance at Denmark’s main music awards, he had a panic attack. It “felt like my body was underwater,” he recalled. He pulled out of the show and public life, only returning with this spring’s arena tour. He is now feeling better, he said, and in recent weeks he released two tracks, “Toget” (“The Train”) and “Orange,” about the year’s challenges and a more hopeful future.

During a 90-minute interview, Rahim said that when it came to breaking through outside Denmark, he did not believe in having a master plan, but would simply go “wherever the river takes me.” He then pointed to a tattoo on his arm of a fish racing through a stream with the word “river” written in Danish above it to show how important the idea was to him.

“I love the world, and I really feel an urge to interact with the world,” Rahim said, “but I also love making music here.”

At the recent arena show, Rahim had decided that — for now at least — he was going to bring the world to Denmark. At the show’s climax, he announced that he was about to play “Kurder I København” (“Kurds in Copenhagen”), a tropical pop song about immigration that ends as a Middle Eastern party tune complete with Kurdish chants and traditional instruments.

He invited several guest singers and musicians onstage, one waving the Kurdish flag, talked about how proud he was to be a Kurd, and then told the crowd he wanted them to all link their pinkie fingers and start bobbing up and down as if dancing at a Kurdish wedding.

As the crowd followed his instructions, Rahim beamed from the stage. In that moment, he looked truly at home.

    "90" : """Upon entering Joe’s Pub at the Public Theater for Suzan-Lori Parks’s “Plays for the Plague Year,” audience members are handed a Playbill, a pencil and two yellow notecards, each with a question about the pandemic: “What would you like to remember?” “What would you like to forget?” The responses are placed in a basket from which they are picked and read during the show. At my performance, someone wrote that they’d like to forget “fear and worry, foreground and background.” People in the audience murmured in assent.

We’d all probably like to forget our own experiences of fear and worry during that first year of zealous hand-washing and ever-changing mask mandates. Parks, however, made a project of remembering: For that first pandemic year, she resolved to write a play a day about “whatever happens,” including the mundane goings-on in her apartment, the deaths of friends and strangers, and the Black Lives Matter protests.

Here, Parks performs a version of herself called the Writer, who creates plays each day while quarantining with her husband (played by Greg Keller) and their 8-year-old son (Leland Fowler) in their one-bedroom apartment.

What unfolds is some configuration of those plays, though “play” is too restrictive a word for these micro-performances, which take the forms of monologues, dialogues and songs. Parks, who also plays the guitar here, is joined onstage by seven other cast members in various roles and a band (Ric Molina, guitar; Graham Kozak, bass; Ray Marchica, percussion).

An accounting of each day — an electronic placard hanging above the stage flashes the date and title of each section, presented chronologically from March 19, 2020, to April 13, 2021 — provides the show with a built-in structure to link what often feels like a hodgepodge.

Parks wisely uses a series of shorthands to quickly bring us back to specific moments in those early pandemic days — an actor, for example, gliding past Parks in an ornate doublet and Tudor-style cap to signal theater closures, the cast hollering and clapping for a brief moment to signal the daily 7 p.m. cheer for frontline workers.

In the plays in which Parks isn’t writing or with her family, she’s talking to a dead Little Richard or negotiating with her Muse who, fed up with Covid, threatens to abandon her. In another, a character named Bob looks for a job. There’s one in which Earth, embodied by a woman wearing a crown of branches and holding a scepter, warns that the pandemic is only the beginning of the world’s disasters.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg appears, on the day of her death, as a triumphant Lady Liberty, and the virus, personified as a horror movie villainess named Corona, wheezes and stalks the stage in a black-gray-white ombré dress and virion headpiece with red “spikes.” The costume design, by Rodrigo Muñoz, is as imaginative and visually stunning as runway couture, especially the layered fabrics of the Muse’s handkerchief hem skirt, made to resemble scraps of paper with scribbled writings, and the 3-D elements, like the butterflies on Earth’s chiffon dress.

But not all days are created equal, and this three-hour production does feel as if we’re reliving a year’s worth of material. At least the variety in Parks’s script keeps things unpredictable enough to hold our attention.

The direction, by Niegel Smith, occasionally gets too darling, like the first scene, when the family members introduce themselves (“I am the writer. I am the hubby. I am the son.”) while passing a red paper heart to one another. But Smith, who also choreographed the show, does make organized chaos in the intimate space (design by Peter Nigrini), rotating characters on a tiny stage adorned with a few pieces of low-sitting furniture — table, armchair, dresser, lamp, rack covered in books.

The show’s music is as eclectic as the storytelling; the songs are short, plucky, with hints of folk, jazz and R&B. The surprising mash-up of genres include the doo-wop style of “Bob Needs a Job,” and the bluesy “Praying Now” soon picks up tempo, turning into an upbeat clap-and-stomp. Most aren’t particularly memorable, but the strongest songs — “RIP the King” and “Whichaway the World” — build with an alternating mix of spoken word/rap and soulful crooning from two performers in particular, Fowler and Danyel Fulton.

Sometimes it seems as if Parks is overreaching, as when she speaks to her former mentor, James Baldwin (perfectly embodied by Fowler, who replicates his posture and cadence of speech), so he can muse about American history. Or in a long ceremony during which the cast hands flowers to the audience at the end of a section about Breonna Taylor, played by Fulton; but Fulton’s performance is poignant enough on its own.

The playwright’s conversations with the dead, however, many of whom begin their scenes unaware or in denial of their demise, is the show’s most compelling motif. She speaks to several who are Black, especially those lost to Covid and those to police brutality. Through these post-mortems, Parks is asking trenchant questions about how we memorialize Black bodies. What would the dead say? How would they want to be remembered, if at all? So the Brooklyn educator Dez-Ann Romain, who died from complications of the coronavirus, snapping “Don’t make me speak of myself in the past tense,” and George Floyd asking, “Would I be safe if Harriet Tubman was on the 20?” become tragic self-written elegies. We’re watching the dead mourn themselves.

Then there’s Parks, who, even playing this version of herself, always feels earnest, as when she listens to the speeches of her characters, while sitting off to one side of the stage, leaning forward attentively. You can easily imagine this being the way Parks sees the world refracted back to her, conversing with the dead, building abstractions.

Unfortunately, her own domestic narrative feels flat by comparison. So “What’s the takeaway? What’s the concept? What’s the tone,” as the Writer’s TV producer asks her at one point during a conversation about the Writer’s plays project.

“Plague Year” never answers these questions; the Writer ultimately discovers that the plays “didn’t save us.” But this isn’t Parks renouncing her ambitious undertaking. She’s offering another way to think about the production, which isn’t always a cohesive work of theater: Perhaps it doesn’t have to.

Theater doesn’t save us, the Writer says, “but it does preserve us somehow,” so this piece still is a record. This is catharsis. It’s preservation.

    "91" : """“Seven-year-old Gloria Metzner, 3607 Park Boulevard, is the youngest working magician in the world,” The Oakland Tribune of California declared in a November 1929 article about her. An accompanying photograph showed Gloria holding three balls between the fingers of her right hand, a moment from a trick in which she would make the balls appear and disappear like, well, magic.

“Anything with sleight-of-hand and billiard balls I liked,” she said almost a century later, in a 2022 interview with KVVU-TV of Las Vegas on the occasion of her 100th birthday. “That was my favorite trick.”

In between those two splashes of publicity, Gloria Metzner adopted the stage name Gloria Dea, made history in Las Vegas, had a few tabloid-ish moments in a brief film career, faded into obscurity for a half-century or so, and then, in her final years, was rediscovered and celebrated by her fellow magicians. Ms. Dea died on March 18 at an assisted living center in Las Vegas, her caregivers told local news outlets. She was 100.

Ms. Dea (pronounced day) might well have died in obscurity if not for a serendipitous confluence of recent events. One catalyst was Lance Rich, a magician and magic historian, who, while doing research for “Neon Dreams: Vegas Greats, Dates and Firsts,” a talk he gave at the Magic Collectors Expo in August 2021, determined that Ms. Dea held a singular distinction: She was, he believes, the first magician ever to perform in a Las Vegas casino.

Other magicians had performed at various venues — an opera house built in 1908, for instance, or in vaudeville halls — but when Ms. Dea did her magic routine in May 1941 in the Round-Up Room of El Rancho Vegas, a recently opened casino and resort, she started the line that led directly to the flashy Las Vegas shows of magicians like David Copperfield and Siegfried & Roy.

Mr. Rich, in a telephone interview, said he was well into his research on Ms. Dea’s life and career when he learned that she was still alive and living in Las Vegas. By happenstance, at almost exactly the same time, AnnaRose Einarsen, a hypnotist and magician, was browsing at a vintage clothing store in Las Vegas when she came across one of Ms. Dea’s old outfits and assorted mementos that were being sold on consignment.

Like Mr. Rich, she found her way to the alive-and-well Ms. Dea, and word began to spread in the magicians’ community about that history-making centenarian. By the time her 100th birthday arrived last August, Mr. Copperfield had proclaimed a Gloria Dea Day, a Clark County commissioner had given her a “Key to the Las Vegas Strip,” and magicians of all stripes turned up for her birthday party.

“Magic should be about taking audiences on journeys,” Mr. Copperfield told The Las Vegas Review-Journal last year. “This whole journey of discovering Gloria, this hidden treasure, has been wondrous, thrilling and very gratifying.”

Mr. Rich detailed her life in a December 2021 article in MUM, the magazine of the Society of American Magicians: Gloria Metzner was born on Aug. 25, 1922, in Oakland, Calif. Her mother, Martha (Heyman) Metzner, was a seamstress, and her father, Leo, was a paint salesman who had a side job as Leo the Magician. Gloria began performing alongside her father and soon was proficient enough to take the spotlight herself.

Interviewed by The Oakland Tribune when she was 11, she said she had an arsenal of 50 tricks and was adding more.

“I can usually see through other people’s tricks, because I’m used to it, you see,” she said. “But to learn to do them takes days of work before the mirror.”

She developed dancing, modeling and other skills as well; in 1940 she was a bit player in an extravaganza called Aquacade at the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco.

Mr. Rich said her versatility helped her land the historic booking at El Rancho. Her magic act was just one element of a revue in which, alongside other performers, she probably also appeared in dance numbers and other bits. But, perhaps owing to her stage presence and attention-getting costumes, she seemed to garner the most attention.

“Her concluding trick, wherein a card jumps from a handkerchief into the core of an orange, was the hit of the show,” The Las Vegas Review-Journal said.

Ms. Dea later took a stab at Hollywood, getting small parts in a dozen or so films. Her personal life drew more publicity than her performances, though. In September 1944, she was working on the musical “Delightfully Dangerous” when the producer paused production long enough for her to marry Jack Statham, the orchestra leader.

“Judge Ida May Adams united the couple in marriage in a brief interval between shooting of scenes in which the bride dances in a clown number,” The Los Angeles Evening Citizen News reported.

The marriage lasted only months.

“Gloria Dea, 22-year-old film actress, today got a divorce from John F. Statham because he always found an excuse not to kiss her,” the United Press agency reported in March 1945. “‘Either he was smoking a cigarette or his pants were just pressed,’ she complained.”

Marriages to Hal Borne and Jack Shulem also didn’t last; the one that did, in 1975, was to Sam Anzalone, who died last year. Ms. Dea leaves no immediate survivors.

One of Ms. Dea’s last movie credits was in Ed Wood’s notoriously bad “Plan 9 From Outer Space” in 1957. She later sold insurance and then cars before settling back in Las Vegas.

Mr. Rich said Ms. Dea was flattered by the late-life rediscovery of her role in Las Vegas history.

“She said, ‘I don’t deserve the attention, but I’ll take it,’” he said.

“She loved being surrounded by new magicians, young magicians,” he added. “She enjoyed seeing magic too.”

At her 100th birthday party, he recalled, “she said, ‘Don’t bring gifts, but if any magicians want to bring magic, that would be great.’”

    "92" : """One hundred years ago, the Eastman Kodak Company introduced a shiny new camera that promised to revolutionize moviemaking. The company had been selling filming devices for more than two decades by then, but this novel contraption — the Ciné-Kodak camera, sold with the Kodascope projector — offered a new thrill: the ability to make and screen movies at home, with no special expertise.

The technical marvel, however, wasn’t just the camera but also the film inside. Until 1923, the film used most commonly in motion pictures was 35 millimeters wide. That year, Kodak produced a new format that was only 16 millimeters. The image wasn’t as sharp when you blew it up on the big screen, but it allowed for smaller, cheaper and more portable cameras.

16 millimeter ushered in a new era of movies made outside the Hollywood system. Regular folks could now record their own lives, journalists and soldiers could film in the midst of war, and activists could shoot political documentaries in the street. Until digital video arrived in the late 1990s, 16-millimeter film was the mainstay of the amateur or independent filmmaker, requiring neither the investment nor the know-how of commercial cinema.

Last week, at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, which holds thousands of 16-millimeter reels in its collection, the film archivist Elena Rossi-Snook projected some shorts for a group of undergraduates from Marymount Manhattan College. As the projector whirred, a beam of light cut through the darkened room, painting the screen with scenes from the 1946 animated “Boundary Lines,” a stirring movie by Philip Stapp about social integrity in the wake of World War II. That was followed by “The End,” an antiwar stoner comedy directed by a teenager, Alfonso Sanchez, in 1968. The third film, “Black Faces” from 1970, was an ebullient, one-minute montage of portraits of Harlem residents.

These productions, precious documents of the lives and concerns of ordinary Americans, have endured, Rossi-Snook explained, because their makers had relatively cheap and convenient access to film, a medium that can last hundreds of years if stored properly.

Today, 16 millimeter is no longer optimal for the amateur filmmaker. Analog film is increasingly expensive, fewer and fewer labs can process it, and the format doesn’t allow the nearly unlimited shooting and instant playback that video does. But even as it turns 100, 16 millimeter still has a unique look that neither 35-millimeter film nor video can rival.

When projected on the screen, analog film has a three-dimensional, pointillist texture called “grain,” a product of its synthetic makeup. There is more grain in 16 millimeter than in 35 millimeter, resulting in a fuzzier, flickering picture. In the 20th century, that was a drawback for professional filmmakers seeking crisp, theatrical images. But today, as high-definition media saturate our lives, some directors choose 16 millimeter precisely for its rougher look. It reminds us that what we’re watching is not the world as is, but filtered and transformed, with great creativity, through a chemical process.

The filmmaker Darren Aronofsky has shot several movies on 16-millimeter film, including “The Wrestler” (2008), “Black Swan” (2010) and “Mother!” (2017). But when he was making his debut feature, “Pi” (1998), 16 millimeter was a necessity, not a choice. The resolution of available digital cameras wasn’t good enough for feature filmmaking at the time, and Aronofsky couldn’t afford 35 millimeter. But he and his cinematographer, Matthew Libatique, soon realized that 16 millimeter — especially the high-contrast stock they used called reversal film — emphasized the hallucinatory style of “Pi,” a black-and-white psychological thriller that delves into the obsessions of a paranoid number theorist.

“We decided to really lean into 16 millimeter,” Aronofsky said in a phone interview. “I wanted the big grain and the contrast-y look. It’s funny, because we just had the 25th anniversary of the film, and we blew it up for IMAX. And the IMAX people were nervous because of how grainy it was. They wanted to know if I wanted to clear out some of the grain with computer technology. And we said, absolutely not. We loved the look of it.”

Several TV shows from the late ’90s and early 2000s, including “The O.C.” and “Sex and the City,” used Super 16, a variation of 16 millimeter with a larger picture area that gave them a sense of real-time immediacy. The first 10 seasons of “The Walking Dead” were also largely shot on 16 millimeter to capture the grimy, crumbling feel of classic horror cinema.

The cinematographer John Inwood, who filmed 150 episodes of the comedy “Scrubs,” recalled that 16-millimeter cameras, which are smaller and lighter than their 35-millimeter counterparts (and even many contemporary professional video cameras), were crucial in developing the series’s frenetic mockumentary style.

“It was good for ‘Scrubs’ because we moved the cameras a lot, and we were sometimes in tight spaces,” he told me. “We shot in an actual hospital, the former North Hollywood hospital, and we shot in every square inch of it, even down to the morgue.”

As digital cameras have become sharper and more versatile, many filmmakers have turned to 16 millimeter to evoke the analog past and the blurry, precarious nature of memory. In an interview with Gold Derby, Newton Thomas Sigel, who filmed Spike Lee’s “Da 5 Bloods” (2020), said the director had insisted to Netflix that they use 16-millimeter reversal film for the sequences set amid the Vietnam War, despite the costs and logistical challenges. The film had to be shipped from Vietnam to an American lab for processing, and by the time the crew members could see what they had shot, Chadwick Boseman’s acting schedule had already ended. But Lee was adamant that the scenes look authentic, like archival newsreels filmed in the field in the 1970s.

The veteran cinematographer Ed Lachman used Super 16 on two of his collaborations with the director Todd Haynes, both of them period dramas: the mini-series “Mildred Pierce” (2011), and “Carol” (2015), which garnered him an Academy Award nomination.

On both projects, the format was chosen to mimic photographic images from the 1940s and ’50s, and the grittiness of postwar America. But Lachman realized that the grain also brought “tension to the surface of the image,” paralleling the repressive qualities of the characters in both “Mildred Pierce” and “Carol.”

For Lachman, the appeal of 16 millimeter transcends nostalgia. It comes down to cinema’s status as an art, meant to stylize rather than simply reproduce reality. He likened film to painting, and grain to brushstrokes. “The grain changes in each frame with exposure,” he said. “It’s like breathing, almost like an anthropomorphic quality.”

The filmmaker Kelly Reichardt recalled that when she started shooting her 2016 feature, “Certain Women,” she didn’t have the budget for 16 millimeter. But when she and her cameraman, Christopher Blauvelt, did test shoots in Montana, where the film is set, Reichardt was horrified at how “flat” the snow looked on video.

“With film stocks, things weren’t so real looking,” Reichardt said. “A lot of it is grain, and 16 has more grain than 35. So when you blow it up, you don’t get the hard lines that you get in HD, which is what you see in sports.”

A grant ultimately allowed Reichardt to shoot “Certain Women” on 16 millimeter. It made the production more laborious, but the results — soft, textured images of wide roads, snowy mountains and grassy plains, all shimmering with light, dust and shadow — made it worth it.

“I guess it’s about beauty, in a way,” Reichardt said. “I remember on ‘30 Rock’ they did a little thing where Lemon walks in front of the HD camera, and it’s like, she’s a skeleton hag. You know? You see every single thing. It’s very unforgiving. For nature, too.”

    "93" : """Dear listeners,
I have heard some truly horrific music at the gym.

I am loathe to even tell you about it, but if I must: I have been subjected to an EDM remix of the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ “Under the Bridge” and a clubby re-imagination of Aerosmith’s “Dream On.” I have heard Iggy Azalea songs that are not “Fancy.” I have experienced things I have had to purge from my memory in order to carry on.

The pandemic forced me, like so many of us, to find ways to work out at home. This was sometimes difficult, and once involved lugging a 20-pound kettlebell nearly a mile home from Target — do not recommend — but it also meant I had much more freedom to determine what I listened to while swinging my new gear around. I started seeking out YouTube workouts without background music, or ones I could do with the sound off. And, naturally, I started making playlists. A bunch of them, actually.

For me, a successful exercise playlist combines novelty and familiarity. It mostly functions to distract my brain from the fact that I am exerting myself and sweating profusely and would much rather not be doing those things, so ideally I want to switch things up to help the time pass. But I also appreciate when a song I know and love comes on when I need some extra motivation. Whether dancing or working out, sometimes moving your body to a song you already know can make you appreciate it in new ways.

I’ve been fine-tuning this playlist for a while, rotating songs out when I get tired of them, or tinkering with the sequencing. I like the way it combines some more recent artists with their influences and forebears (a dynamic explicitly captured by Daft Punk’s great, shouted-out homage to its heroes, “Teachers,” from what itself is now a dance music landmark, “Homework,” from 1997). This is not the playlist I go to for my most high-intensity workouts or runs, though I’ll definitely share one of those in a future Amplifier. This is instead something slightly more sustained and intermittently low-key — a playlist I’d listen to when doing a strength-training routine, a jog or a very brisk walk.

Rest assured, you are not required to move a muscle while listening to it. Maybe you just need an energetic, gradually crescendoing pick-me-up in the middle of a long workday. But be forewarned: There’s always a chance these songs will inspire a spontaneous dance party.

Listen along here on Spotify as you read.

1. Caroline Polachek: “So Hot You’re Hurting My Feelings (A.G. Cook Remix)”
A.G. Cook, one of the wily masterminds behind the PC Music collective, reworked this dreamy version of a fun, flirty Caroline Polachek single from her 2019 album, “Pang.” (Listen on YouTube)

2. Jessie Ware: “Free Yourself”
The British pop musician Jessie Ware — my personal favorite instigator of a recent disco revival — found a new groove with her great 2020 album, “What’s Your Pleasure?” She released this thumping, house-inflected jam last year as what seemed like a one-off single, but it will also appear on her next album, “That! Feels Good!,” which comes out later this month. (Listen on YouTube)

3. Anita Ward: “Ring My Bell”
Speaking of disco, why not go straight to the source with this blissful, weightless 1979 hit? I’m a fan of the eight-minute extended mix myself, but in the interest of keeping things moving, I opted for the three-and-a-half-minute single edit here. (Listen on YouTube)

4. Giorgio Moroder: “From Here to Eternity”
The ascending synthesizer arpeggios make this title track from Giorgio Moroder’s landmark 1977 album feel truly heavenly. (The opening vocoder line is a little callback to that A.G. Cook remix earlier in the playlist, too.) (Listen on YouTube)

5. Yaeji: “Raingurl”
The New York-born songwriter and D.J. Yaeji strays from her dance-music roots a bit on “With a Hammer,” the eclectic debut album she put out earlier this month. But for the purposes of this playlist, I prefer this playful and pulsating cult favorite from 2017. (Listen on YouTube)

6. Daft Punk: “Teachers”
The iconic French duo nods to the artists who inspire them on this fluid and funky cut from the group’s 1997 breakout album, “Homework.” (Listen on YouTube)

7. Robyn & La Bagatelle Magique featuring Maluca: “Love Is Free”
The euphoric 2015 EP “Love Is Free” marked the final collaboration between Swedish pop star Robyn and her longtime friend, the late producer and D.J. Christian Falk. This kinetic, house-inspired title track is the project’s undeniable highlight. (Listen on YouTube)

8. Alicia Keys: “In Common (Xpect Remix)”
A minor Alicia Keys hit that should have been a massive one, “In Common” inspired its own remix EP featuring re-workings by four different producers. I like this one by Xpect, which dials up the original’s Afrobeats sound. (Listen on YouTube)

9. Todd Edwards: “Shall Go”
The garage pioneer Todd Edwards got a shout-out from Daft Punk on the aforementioned “Teachers” — and then he started working with the group on later albums “Discovery” and “Random Access Memories.” I love this transcendent title track from his 2012 EP “Shall Go.” (Listen on YouTube)

10. Daphni: “Yes, I Know”
Also from 2012, here’s a soulful and transfixing track from the dance project of Dan Snaith (who also records as Caribou), centered around a memorable sample from Buddy Miles’s 1971 song “The Segment.” (Listen on YouTube)

11. Britney Spears: “Stronger”
Oops! I just couldn’t resist. (Listen on YouTube)

    "94" : """“Emilie: La Marquise du Châtelet Defends Her Life Tonight” starts with a death adjourned. Emilie (Amy Michelle), a mathematician and philosophe, has slipped through a loophole in the space-time continuum and now lingers in an uncanny valley between life and death. She has been allotted limited time to determine whether her legacy amounts to one of “loving” or “knowing.”

The words “love” and “philosophy” are inscribed on an upstage wall and throughout this play, by Lauren Gunderson, Emilie returns to that makeshift chalkboard to tally up her life’s deeds. As a dramaturgical device, it’s more prosaic than piquant, yet not entirely off brand for a woman whose mind was a perpetual motion machine.

The play’s protagonist is based on the real-life du Châtelet, famed in 18th-century France for her translation of and commentary on Newton’s “Principia” and for a treatise she wrote on the nature and propagation of fire. Such an accomplished woman hardly needs defending, but defining a life is another matter. That is the real brief for “Emilie.”

In her state of limbo, the marquise discovers that she can’t intervene in past events. Any kind of physical contact will immediately set off a blackout, as if someone has shaken a cosmic Etch A Sketch. As a workaround, Erika Vetter plays a younger version of the marquise, enacting a telescoped version of her life. Where Michelle’s marquise is ruled by an Apollonian temperament, Vetter puts a heavy thumb on the “love” scale. “Are you jealous that I’m sharing orbits with another man?” she teases Voltaire, du Châtelet’s lover in real life.

Under Kathy Gail MacGowan’s direction, many of the actors play multiple roles, underscoring the similarities between certain characters. Bonnie Black delivers compelling performances as both the marquise’s mother, a woman of mean understanding, and the meddlesome Madam Graffigny, a not entirely welcome guest at the marquise’s family estate.

Unlike those two women, bound by corsets, Emilie wears a simple nightgown, which allows her to move freely from her chaise longue to her desk on Sarah White’s handsome set. Her mind moves just as nimbly from an appraisal of Gottfried Leibniz to a discussion of “living force,” a scientific concept for kinetic energy first developed by Leibniz and later elaborated upon by Emilie.

For all the talk of life forces, however, there’s a lack of kinetic energy between the elder marquise and Voltaire, who is reduced to a concupiscent kibitzer with a string of chronic ailments. The first act is also dragged down by exposition. “Did I mention I was married? We’re skipping ahead.” “Did I mention I had children? Three. Fascinating creatures,” the marquise maunders on. Such palavering is wasted time for a woman facing a literal deadline.

Gunderson, whose other work includes plays about pioneering women like Marie Curie, does more than pay hagiographic tribute to her subjects. There are angles of regret in her portrait of the marquise, who ultimately feels that she failed to provide enough opportunities for her daughter. Even as the lights dim, she is preoccupied with “love and so many questions,” and it becomes impossible to tell where loving leaves off and knowing begins.

    "95" : """A new stage production by Joël Pommerat is always an event in France. At 60, he is widely recognized as one of the greatest directors and playwrights working in the country today, a theater maker with rare box-office appeal. Yet unlike many of his peers, Pommerat hasn’t parlayed this success into an ever busier schedule of new productions.

Since 2015, he has brought just three new plays to domestic and international stages, starting with his French Revolution-inspired juggernaut “It Will Be Fine (1) End of Louis.” This month, he is back in Paris with a much more modest endeavor: “Amours (2)” (“Loves (2)”), a 70-minute medley of fragments from Pommerat’s previous works, reinvented for an audience of around 40.

This shrunken scale doesn’t make “Amours (2),” which is nominated for best public-sector production at this year’s Molière theater awards, any less effective. If anything, it showcases Pommerat’s art — his taut writing, delivered in piercing vignettes — more intimately than ever.

The show isn’t performed on a traditional stage: The production requires merely a backdrop and chairs on three sides of a square space. (In Paris, it was staged at Pavillon Villette, a venue often rented out for receptions and conferences.) There were practical reasons for this format: “Amours (2)” is a reworking of “Amours (1),” a production that Pommerat created at a French prison in 2019.

Pommerat has been working with prisoners in Arles, southern France, for nearly a decade. His first two collaborations featured full casts drawn from the jail there, and were performed inside the prison for small audiences. But the security and logistics for these events were demanding, and prison officials asked for a simpler setup for “Amours (1).”

Four years later, two of the prisoners he worked with in Arles — Jean Ruimi and Redwane Rajel — have been released, and are working as professional actors with Pommerat’s theater troupe, the Louis Brouillard Company. “Amours (2)” starts with those actors seated in the audience.

As a spokeswoman finishes a preshow announcement, Rajel’s irritated voice rises: “Just stop!” He and Ruimi, playing Rajel’s father, launched into an argument — apologizing along the way for the disruption, as if it were a spontaneous exchange. (Some onlookers believed it was, and tried to shush them.)

Three actresses join Ruimi and Rajel and the show plays out in a dozen scenes between two or three characters, drawn from earlier Pommerat pieces: “This Child” (2006), “Circles/Fictions” (2010) and “The Reunification of the Two Koreas” (2013). Love, the overarching theme, takes many forms throughout, from intense friendship to filial affection and long-term companionship.

Yet it is consistently laced with pain and misunderstanding. In one scene, a deep rift opens up between two best friends because their recollections of their first meeting differ. In another vignette, two neighbors wait for their spouses to return, until it dawns on them that the missing partners are having an affair.

While Pommerat has honed a distinctive stage aesthetic over the years, with dusky lighting and an eerie, quietly cutting delivery style for actors, “Amours (2)” does away with technical wizardry and goes back to basics. The plain, bright lighting and compact space lessens the distance between the audience and highlights the spare yet mysterious quality of Pommerat’s writing.

The three women onstage — Marie Piemontese, Elise Douyère and Roxane Isnard — are all faultless, with Isnard an especially versatile presence from scene to scene, projecting teenage anger as easily as quiet, mature tension. Yet Ruimi and Rajel, the two former convicts, bring a different dimension to “Amours (2).”

Ruimi, a former high-profile member of a Marseille crime ring who served a lengthy sentence in connection with several killings and drug trafficking, draws attention with a nervy intensity. When he plays vulnerable characters — like a man paying daily visits to his amnesiac wife, who keeps forgetting who he is — his toughness almost seems to crack in real time.

Rajel, who has also performed roles with the French director Olivier Py, is a softer presence, with a gift for delivering quiet blows in dialogue. “Amours (2)” is a testament to Ruimi and Rajel’s talent and hard work, yet their life experiences shape their stage presence, too.

That is one of the benefits of social diversity in the arts. It’s an uphill struggle for actors from tough backgrounds to make it as professionals, with drama schools increasingly out of financial reach in Europe and the United States. Yet their presence makes for richer, fuller worlds onstage. “Amours (2)” is certainly proof, and is bound to become another Pommerat classic.

    "96" : """After nearly 11 years in operation, one of New York City’s most high-profile cabaret venues has decided to transition from a commercial entity to a nonprofit. The owners of 54 Below, a popular forum for both Broadway stars and rising performers and composers, say they intend to raise close to 20 percent of an annual budget approaching $10 million from supporters, with sponsorships, multiyear donations and naming opportunities figuring into the new model.

Richard Frankel, one of the owners, described the move as motivated by both economic challenges and artistic ambitions. “There’s no doubt it’s been a struggle, financially, combining the restaurant and theater businesses,” he said, adding that the club, which occupies the space below the 1970s nightlife fixture-turned-Broadway theater Studio 54, “puts on about 600 shows a year, which is insane. So we have a structure that’s not cheap.”

Those shows have included performances by marquee names such as Patti LuPone, Kelli O’Hara and Brian Stokes Mitchell, as well as series and concerts spotlighting lesser-known artists and works. “Diversity has become very important to us, presenting new musicals and young performers, many of color,” Frankel said. “And we want to be able to pay them more and expand the audience, with artist subsidies and ticket subsidies. That can be very difficult, if not impossible, to do on a self-sustaining commercial basis.”

Frankel noted that two of 54 Below’s competitors, Joe’s Pub and Dizzy’s Club, both enjoy the backing of nonprofit organizations: the Public Theater and Jazz at Lincoln Center. “We’ve been incredibly envious of them,” Frankel said.

As a nonprofit, 54 Below will focus on raising money to offer discounted tickets and subsidize artists’ production costs, as well as continue livestreaming its performances.

A newly formed board for 54 Below includes, in addition to Frankel and his fellow owners, names from the entertainment, business and nonprofit sectors, among them the actress and entrepreneur Brenda Braxton; Robert L. Dilenschneider, president and chief executive of the Dilenschneider Group, Inc; Stanley Richards, deputy chief executive of the Fortune Society; and Lucille Werlinich, chair of the Purchase College Foundation.

54 Below opened in June 2012 and entered a partnership with the veteran performer and American songbook champion Michael Feinstein in 2015; that collaboration ended in July 2022, and Feinstein teamed up with Cafe Carlyle. Last June, 54 Below received an honor at the Tony Awards for excellence in the theater.

“I’m expecting the funding sources to be generous, though I don’t know how many Santa Clauses there can be,” Frankel said. “But we’re committed to this, as a way for us to survive and thrive in the future.”

    "97" : """It was a gripping case that was one of the first to draw a daily national audience to a televised criminal trial. Two affluent young men were charged three decades ago with murdering their parents by marching into the den of their Beverly Hills mansion with shotguns and unloading more than a dozen rounds on their mother and father while they sat on the couch.

Lyle and Erik Menendez were convicted in 1996 of murdering their mother, Mary Louise, a former beauty queen who went by Kitty, and their father, Jose, a music executive, despite defense arguments that the brothers had been sexually molested for years by their father, and had killed out of fear.

Now, Roy Rosselló, a former member of Menudo, the boy band of the 1980s that became a global sensation, is coming forward with an allegation that he was sexually assaulted as a teenager by Jose Menendez.

The assertion was aired on Tuesday in a segment on the “Today” show that outlined some of the findings of a three-part docuseries scheduled to air on Peacock, the streaming service from NBCUniversal, beginning on May 2. The series, “Menendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed,” based on reporting by the journalists Robert Rand and Nery Ynclan, is largely focused on Mr. Rosselló. He describes an encounter with Mr. Menendez but also recounts separate incidents of sexual abuse that he says were inflicted on him by one of Menudo’s former managers when he sang as part of the group.

“I know what he did to me in his house,” Mr. Rosselló says of Mr. Menendez in the clip of the docuseries that aired on “Today.”

It is unclear what impact, if any, Mr. Rosselló’s account will have on efforts by defense lawyers to secure a new trial for the brothers, whose prior appeals have been denied.

The credibility of the brothers’ account, and the admissibility of defense arguments that pointed to sex abuse as a mitigating factor in the case, was central to the criminal trials that unfolded after the discovery of the murders in 1989. The first prosecution, which began in 1993, ended with two hung juries and mistrials. When the brothers were retried together two years later, they were found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison, where they remain.

The Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office, which prosecuted the cases in the 1990s, did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Tuesday morning.

The “Today” report previewed interviews with Mr. Rosselló in which he is said to describe a visit to the Menendez home in New Jersey when he was 14 — a visit during which he says Jose Menendez drugged and raped him.

“That’s the man here that raped me,” he says in a clip of the docuseries, pointing to Mr. Menendez in a photo. “That’s the pedophile.”

He is also heard saying, “It’s time for the world to know the truth.”

Mr. Menendez was affiliated with Menudo because he had signed the group as an executive of RCA Records.

Mr. Rosselló has previously described being sexually abused as part of Menudo. Others have also said they were verbally, physically, emotionally and sexually abused as part of the band in the four-part HBO Max docuseries “Menudo: Forever Young.” No one has ever been criminally charged in connection to the allegations.

One of Kitty Menendez’s brothers, Milton Andersen, 88, used an expletive to describe Mr. Rosselló’s allegation as flatly false and said the Menendez brothers should not be set free.

Mr. Andersen said his brother-in-law was not a sexual predator and objected to the idea that the new accusation could in any way lead to Lyle and Erik having their case re-examined.

“They do not deserve to walk on the face of this earth after killing my sister and my brother-in-law,” he said.

The Menendez murders drew wide public attention, in part because the brothers had been children of affluence. Lyle was attending Princeton at the time of the killings. Erik was pursuing a career in professional tennis. Prosecutors presented them as coldblooded killers, interested in getting unfettered access to their parents’ $14 million estate.

Jose Menendez was shot five times, including once in the back of the head. By the brothers’ own testimony, after they had discharged several rounds, Lyle went to his car, reloaded his 12-gauge shotgun, and pushed the muzzle of his gun to his mother’s cheek and shot her again.

The police initially believed that the slayings were tied to the Mafia. But investigators turned their attention to Lyle, who was 22 at the time of his arrest, and Erik, 19, after the brothers bought Rolex watches, condominiums, sports cars and other items in the months after the murders.

Though they initially denied any role in the killings, they became primary suspects after the discovery of taped recordings of conversations the brothers had with their psychologist in which the brothers explained what had led them to kill their parents.

As the first trial neared, the brothers’ defense lawyers came forward with their own explanation for the crimes: that Lyle had confronted his father about the family’s sex abuse secrets, that his father had become enraged and threatening, and that the brothers had killed out of concern for their lives.

The defense argued that the murder charges should be reduced to manslaughter because the defendants had honestly, if incorrectly, believed that their lives were imminently threatened.

The trials, which played out on Court TV, ushered in a new era of televised courtroom drama. At least some jurors in the first set of trials believed the brothers, who had movingly testified of the abuse they suffered. The testimony left the jurors split between manslaughter and murder verdicts and contributed to the impasse that led to the mistrials.

When another jury convened to decide the brothers’ fate, the circumstances had changed. The judge banned cameras in court and severely restricted witness testimony and evidence related to Jose Menendez’s parenting. Prosecutors, who had let the brothers’ molestation accusations go unchallenged at the first trials, went right at Erik Menendez when he took the stand, seeding doubt about whether the abuse had happened at all.

“Can you give us the name of one eyewitness to any of the sexual assaults that took place in that home,” the lead prosecutor, David Conn, repeatedly asked Erik Menendez, as he ticked through the places the brothers had lived.

According to transcripts of the testimony, Mr. Menendez kept repeating the same answer: “No.”

The defense also did not present at trial anyone beyond the brothers who described Mr. Menendez as a sexual predator.

As the trial wound to a close, the judge, Stanley M. Weisberg, ruled that the “abuse excuse” argument could not be used at all. The ruling essentially forced jurors to decide between letting the brothers off entirely, or convicting them of murder.

They did the latter.

“We did think there was psychological abuse to some extent. I think most of us believed that,” one juror, Lesley Hillings, told The Los Angeles Times afterward. “Sexual abuse? I don’t think we’ll ever know if that’s true or not.”

Legal experts said that even with the new allegation brought by Mr. Rosselló, the lawyers defending the Menendez brothers would face an uphill battle if they sought to have the case re-examined.

Laurie L. Levenson, a professor of criminal law at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who provided legal analysis of the Menendez case in the 1990s, said Mr. Rosselló’s information might come “too little, too late.”

“In the end, in the second trial, the jury just didn’t believe them,” Professor Levenson said of the brothers and their sex abuse allegations.

Mr. Rosselló’s account “could be something you could file with the court and claim that it’s newly discovered evidence and that it would have made a difference in the case,” she added. “But they will have the burden to show that.”

In the segment aired by “Today,” Alan Jackson, a criminal defense lawyer, agreed that the brothers had “a big mountain to climb.” Still, he said the assertion brought forward by Mr. Rosselló provided the brothers a “glimmer of hope.”

    "99" : """Films directed by performers like Chelsea Peretti, Michael Shannon and Randall Park will be a focus of the 2023 Tribeca Festival, organizers said Tuesday as they announced the event lineup. Also on the schedule will be the premiere of a Marvel documentary about the iconic comic book writer Stan Lee.

This year’s festival, which will run in Lower Manhattan from June 7 to 18, will include 109 feature films from 127 filmmakers across 36 countries. Among those filmmakers will be 43 first-timers.

“The Tribeca Festival is a celebratory event that honors artists and uplifts attendees, and this year is no exception,” the festival’s co-founder, Jane Rosenthal, said in a statement, adding that the event will offer “storytelling as a powerful tool of democracy, activism and social awareness.”

Peretti, an actor perhaps best known for her work on “Brooklyn Nine-Nine,” will bring to Tribeca the world premiere of “First Time Female Director,” a comedy she also wrote about a woman director  struggling to fill the shoes of her male predecessor.

Shannon went behind the camera for “Eric LaRue,” a world-premiere drama in which parents grappling with the fallout of their son’s shocking crime seek solace in rival religious congregations.

And Park, whose acting career took off after he landed a starring role in the television sitcom “Fresh Off the Boat,” will take “Shortcomings” to Tribeca after it screened earlier this year at the Sundance Film Festival.

Also in the lineup will be the world premieres of “Maggie Moore(s)” by John Slattery;  “Fresh Kills” by Jennifer Esposito; and the North American premiere of “The Listener” by Steve Buscemi.

The Marvel documentary “Stan Lee,” from the director David Gelb, will be among the 53 nonfiction features at the festival.

The festival is known for its live events and several are scheduled for the 2023 edition. Sara Bareilles will perform after the world premiere of “Waitress, the Musical — Live on Broadway!,” which features her music and lyrics. Gloria Gaynor will perform following the world premiere of the documentary “Gloria Gaynor: “I Will Survive.” And a conversation with Dan Rather and the director Frank Marshall will take place after the world premiere of the film “Rather.”

    "100" : """There are some arias that are so beloved, so virtually indestructible, that they more or less sing themselves. Think of “La donna è mobile” or “Vissi d’arte.” A good performance gets audiences applauding; a great one transports them.

“Una furtiva lagrima,” with its teary sighs and bursts of joy, is one of those arias, and when the 27-year-old Spanish tenor Xabier Anduaga sang it on Sunday in the Metropolitan Opera’s revival of Donizetti’s frolicsome comedy “L’Elisir d’Amore,” time seemed to stop. Cutting a lonely figure in a field against a midnight-blue sky, he sang with enchanting beauty. He took the second verse in a beguilingly soft tone and rounded out the cadenza with a convincing messa di voce — one more polished than the rendition captured on video last week.

Anduaga’s soigné style, and vibrant yet plangent timbre, made him an uncommonly sensitive Nemorino — more of a melancholy-prone Werther scribbling poeticisms in a notebook than a sunny country bumpkin mooning over his beloved. His gracefully produced sound nevertheless carried wonderfully throughout the Met’s vast auditorium, and his acting, subtly charming instead of cloyingly eager, was of a piece with his voice.

Still, Anduaga missed opportunities that seemed tailor-made for him — the descending lines of “Adina, credimi” lost their legato — but once he figures out how to bring his ravishing vocalism to the less showy parts of this role, it will no doubt become a signature one.

Nemorino has his eye on a woman who is worldlier than he — he admires her studiousness in his first aria — and Aleksandra Kurzak’s confident, intuitive way with Adina’s music, reflecting a long familiarity with coloratura roles, implicitly conveyed that quality. Some breathiness perforated her tone, and her vibrato widened at high volume, but she did tap into the magic of her early coloratura days with a silvery, delicately vulnerable “Prendi.”

The baritone Joshua Hopkins, who sang Papageno in Julie Taymor’s production of “The Magic Flute” earlier this season, turned in another fantastic performance. With a velvety tone, cocked eyebrow and dash of swagger, his Belcore was as much a macho sensualist as a cartoonish military sergeant. Even though “Come Paride” is something of a gag — nodding as it does to Dandini’s supercilious “Come un’ape” from Rossini’s “La Cenerentola” — Hopkins’s evenly textured, firmly woven sound elevated it to a thing of beauty. Elsewhere, his patter percolated, creating a smooth yet lively murmur.

Bartlett Sher’s production has Dulcamara arrive in a gilded carriage bearing his snake oils, and as opera’s favorite charlatan, Alex Esposito traded basso buffoonery for the tradition of slippery salesmen like Pirelli and Harold Hill.

The conductor Michele Gamba painted in dusky pastels, finding unanimity of color in swelling strings and pearly woodwinds. There were occasional ensemble issues, but once the opera entered its final stretch — with “Una furtiva lagrima” flowing into “Prendi” and on to the all’s-well finale — Donizetti’s sturdily constructed masterwork seemed to take care of itself.

    "101" : """The realization hit her during a performance.

Virginia Johnson, the artistic director of Dance Theater of Harlem, was watching the company in the fall of 2019 when she knew it was time to step down.

“I was like, Wait — there’s a company up there,” she said in an interview in her Dance Theater office. “There they are. That’s it.”

This mission accomplished moment came after close to a decade of work. When she took over the artistic reins of Dance Theater in 2010, Arthur Mitchell, one of its founders and for many years her boss, told her, “Your job is to revive the company,” she said.

Watching the dancers in the company she had rebuilt, she was impressed by their technique, by the way they had melded into a group. “I said, OK, well here they are.”

But she knew they were ready for the next step. “They needed more push,” she said. “I’m a nurturer. I wanted to make sure that I was trying to help them dance out of a sense of joy, a sense of positive growth — that I didn’t want to make them grow out of a sense of fear.”

She realized they needed that push — and a new vision. “They need somebody to challenge them in new ways,” she said, “to make them better, to make them stronger, to take them to the next level, and I’m not the right one to do that. I did my part.”

And while she didn’t do it alone, Johnson played an important role in reviving the organization’s gem, its storied professional company, which had been forced to go on hiatus for several years because of financial difficulties. (Along with the company, Dance Theater has a school and community programs, including Dancing Through Barriers, which provides ballet education to students, mainly in public schools.)

Lorraine Graves, a former principal, said the company was “kind of lost” and credits Johnson with helping to put “Dance Theater of Harlem back on the map.” She was successful in “really holding on through adversity and challenging times,” Graves said, “and trying to give dancers a home continuously after such a long hiatus.”

And then, Graves added, “to also survive the pandemic? To be able to hold on through that was actually quite a feat.”

Johnson, 73, will preside over the company’s final New York City Center season, Wednesday through Sunday. Robert Garland, the company’s longtime resident choreographer and director of its school, will take over on July 1.

Garland is an essential part of Dance Theater, dating back to his time as a principal. Not only did he dance and choreograph under the mentorship of Mitchell — who formed Dance Theater with Karel Shook in 1969 after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. — but his musical braiding of classical ballet with Black vernacular dance is unparalleled in its skill and soul.

Johnson is more than pleased. “Robert worked with Arthur Mitchell,” she said. “It’s like how many artistic directors are changing places this year? Everybody is doing a search. But this is coming from inside.”

As Johnson added: “You do have to evolve. And Robert is just the perfect person for this.”

She recognizes that there is anxiety, too, but sees that as natural — and good. And she is firm on one point: She doesn’t consider herself an artistic director, though that was her title. “I don’t have that kind of vision, I don’t have that kind of skill,” she said. “I’ve had an amazing experience here. But now it’s time for me to do something different.”

As a founding member of the company and one of its star ballerinas, Johnson danced with Dance Theater for 28 years before retiring at 47. “How could I have lasted that long?” she said.

When she retired she wanted to be a normal person, with a normal life. She went on to become the editor in chief of Pointe magazine before returning to Dance Theater at Mitchell’s request. “How could I say no?” she said. “This is the person who gave me everything I dreamed of in my life. It was time for me to pay back.”

She is firm about something else, too: She didn’t trade her freedom for ballet. “I’m always angry about people who write about or talk about all of the sacrifices,” she said. “OK, so there was some pain. OK, so there were a few things I gave up. Look what I got. I got to have a life in ballet.”

She started dancing at the age of 3, going on to train at the Washington School of Ballet under Mary Day. It was Day, a white woman, who eventually told her that ballet wasn’t going to fit into her future. Johnson said her words were: “There are no Black ballerinas. Nobody’s going to hire you.’

“Look, I was in her school for six years,” Johnson continued. “She trained me. She gave me opportunities. I had principal roles in her ballets. But she was telling me what the world was. And that was good.”

That was before Mitchell, the first Black principal at City Ballet, started Dance Theater and cultivated dozens of Black ballerinas like Johnson and Graves, along with Lydia Abarca-Mitchell, Stephanie Dabney and many more. The company made Johnson’s career in ballet possible; and, even now, she said, she knows the world needs Dance Theater of Harlem.

“People still do think about ballet as this art form that came from the 19th century — so beautiful and so precious in that 19th century way,” she said. “They don’t realize that it is a living art form that needs to be true to the time that it lives in. And so especially now, people need to see that this art form of ballet belongs to everybody. You have to have a lot to be able to succeed in it. But if you’re given the opportunity to develop that lot, then the art form itself will be better.”

Dance Theater of Harlem continues to play a role in providing those opportunities — and more. “Special place,” she said. “Special idea. We have never been a Black ballet company. We have always been about being a company that is representative of humanity.

“Certainly, every one of us in that first company has been told, ‘You don’t belong in ballet.’ So it was a place for us to be. And now there are more places for us to be, but the vision of ballet being an art form that’s about humanity rather than about one culture — people still don’t get that.”

While Johnson’s future plans aren’t concrete, she said she would like to go back to being an artist. She isn’t sure what that means exactly but knows it will involve writing. Just don’t expect her life story, though she kept journals throughout her illustrious career. “There will be no memoirs,” she said. “Gosh. Life is for living!”

So what will she write? “I have two novels going,” she said. “But they’re going, not going — in process. It’s a really weird thing: You have an idea, and you start, but you don’t end up where you think you’re going to end up. I’m a big reader, and I have so many people that I love their writings. I’m going to try to do this? To understand how to put a character together and how to make that moment when something clicks? I’d love to be able to do that.”

One thing she won’t do: Be connected with the company. “I’m going to do an Arthur Mitchell,” she said, referring to how he stayed out of the picture during her tenure. “I think it’s the best way. It’s confusing when you have too many heads in the room.”

The future of Dance Theater looks solid, but the company represents more than these dancers. When Johnson’s teacher told her there would be no place for her in ballet, Johnson wasn’t deterred. She is, however, surprised when she tells that story and people are shocked; it means that they aren’t observant. “Look at this country, and you’re shocked that somebody would say that?” she said. “This country is very good at being oblivious about its shortcomings. It did not pause my desire.”

And she didn’t run out of the room crying. “It was more like, I’m doing this,” she said. “This is what I love. And that’s why I loved Dance Theater of Harlem. Not because it gave me the chance to be a ballerina, but because it gave me the chance to say, in the United States of America, this is who I am, and I am doing this.”
