    "1": """Every day this week, hundreds of visitors to the National Gallery in London have marveled at “After Impressionism” — an acclaimed exhibition examining how, at the turn of the 20th century, painters including Van Gogh, Cézanne and Picasso pushed art in bold new directions.

So, too, have art lovers visiting an institution 1,700 miles away: the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, in Moscow.
    
Before Russia invaded Ukraine, the two museums were collaborating on a single “After Impressionism” show, which would bring together masterpieces from each institution’s vast museum holdings. The exhibition was to open in London and then travel to Moscow. Now the shows are divorced; the National Gallery’s version of Cézanne’s “Bathers” will be seen only in London, while Henri Matisse’s “The Pink Studio,” a major painting of bright color and vivid decoration from 1911, will stay put in Moscow.

Over the past year, the National Gallery’s curators searched worldwide for paintings and sculptures to replace the 15 masterpieces that had been expected from Russia. The Pushkin’s curators, in turn, refocused its “After Impressionism,” which opened on Tuesday, toward Russian artists. Last year, Olga Lyubimova, Russia’s culture minister, said it was vital that exhibitions that had been planned with foreign museums went ahead, even when those museums now refused to loan works to Russia.

At a time when Western opera houses and concert halls are grappling with whether to resume work with Russian singers and musicians, the bifurcated “After Impression” exhibition shows that Western museums are holding firm in deciding to cut off Russian state institutions until the war is over. Although phone calls between colleagues on both sides continue, Russian museums are otherwise sealed off from Western influences and partnerships.

In recent statements, Russia’s culture ministry has downplayed the impact of isolation, and trumpeted potential cultural collaborations with nations that have not condemned the war, including China, Oman, and even Cuba.

MaryAnne Stevens, the lead curator of the National Gallery’s “After Impressionism,” said in an interview that the situation felt like a throwback to the 1970s, when Westerners struggled to borrow from Russia’s incredible collections of art and were hampered in academic research. “It’s deeply depressing and very saddening,” she said.

That sense of Russia being shut off has only grown in recent weeks as the government changed the leadership at several of Moscow’s biggest museums, pushing out directors that promoted joint projects with Western institutions.

Last month, Marina Loshak, the Pushkin’s longtime director and a driving force behind the joint “After Impressionism” show, resigned after 10 years in the role.

In a statement on the Puskin’s social media accounts, she said it was time for a new director “to come with new energy, with new thoughts and with new ambitions.” But to many in Russia, Loshak’s position had become untenable because her daughter, Anna Mongayt, is an opposition journalist who opposes the war. Loshak said in an interview with The Art Newspaper Russia that she wanted to leave the Pushkin on her own terms. Loshak was replaced by Elizaveta Likhacheva, previously the head of Russia’s Shchusev Museum of Architecture.

In February, there was a similar changing of the guard at the State Tretyakov Gallery, another of Moscow’s major museums, when the culture ministry announced the abrupt dismissal of Zelfira Tregulova, the Tretyakov Gallery’s steadfastly independent director since 2015. She was replaced by Elena Pronicheva, who previously ran the Polytechnic Museum, a science collection, in Moscow.

Under Tregulova’s leadership, the Tretyakov Gallery staged or hosted several surprising contemporary art shows — including one that celebrated diversity and European unity — and lent works from its collection across Europe. In January, the ministry wrote to the museum urging it to do more to promote “traditional Russian spiritual and moral values,” according to a report in The Moscow Times. A few weeks later, the ministry decided not to renew Tregulova’s contract. Tregulova told reporters she learned of the decision in the press.
    
Both Loshak and Tregulova turned down interview requests for this article; the Pushkin and Tretyakov museums did not respond to similar requests.

Catherine Phillips, a British art historian who had worked with the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg since the 1990s, said in an interview that although the changes were stark, they seemed more about the government wanting to show its power over cultural life, rather than seeking to alter the museums’ content or “micromanage the culture.”

Yet there has been a more patriotic turn in the past decade in some of Russia’s museums, particularly its military and historical institutions. Over the past year, Lyubimova, the culture minister, has visited and praised several such shows, including a Moscow exhibition venerating Russia’s warrior saints. The show had perhaps been conceived “in a completely different setting, with a different message,” she said, according to a news release, but it was “all the more providential to open this exhibition today.”

Of all of Russia’s museums, the Hermitage — founded in the 18th century by Catherine the Great, a German princess who became Russia’s empress — has had the greatest ties to Western Europe. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Hermitage recalled numerous loans, including Fabergé eggs at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, paintings at the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris and a Picasso portrait from an Italian museum.

The Hermitage’s director, Mikhail Piotrovsky, remains in place. The museum’s head since 1990, Piotrovsky is close to President Vladimir Putin of Russia and has made statements backing Russia’s invasion. Last year, in an interview with a Russian newspaper, Piotrovsky, said he felt “stabbed in the back” when foreign museums cut ties with his institution.

In an emailed statement, Piotrovsky said “the blockade of Russia’s museums” had forced the museum to change how it operates. “We have been looking into the opportunities for holding exhibitions from private collections and from friendly countries,” he said.

With fewer international tourists, the museum is pivoting to maintain its global presence. Piotrovsky said the Hermitage was becoming more active online, a move that includes offering virtual museum tours. In March, the museum began broadcasting live feeds from webcams trained on of two of its greatest modern masterpieces — Matisse’s “Dance” and “Music” — so that art lovers outside Russia could still see them.

The museum would also work outside Russia by hosting events in Asia, the Middle East and the Balkans, Piotrovsky said, but did not explain what those would involve.

Officially, Russia’s museums may now be looking Eastward, but Vladimir Opredelenov, a former deputy director at the Pushkin Museum, who left after Russia’s invasion, said in an email interview that Western and Russian museums were still collaborating, just in “more veiled and bizarre forms” rather than via official channels.

Once the war’s over, “we will see that museums will be among the first to set an example” and resume cultural exchange, he added, because “both sides equally understand the value of maintaining human relationships.”

Until then, Opredelenov said, Russian museums need to work with countries in the Middle East and Asia to help spread their creativity: “I hope that the world community understands and accepts this.”

    "2": """ The stoops of brownstone Brooklyn, on which residents routinely leave freebies for passers-by, are a reliable metric of current literary tastes — and distastes. In that fervid summer of 2018 when prominent men were being publicly accused of bad behavior right and left, I found there juxtaposed Woody Allen’s “Side Effects” and Garrison Keillor’s “Lake Wobegon Days,” amusing in a way those humorists never intended. Nearby, someone had huffily discarded a copy of Mario Batali’s “Molto Italiano.” My shelf of scandal was getting more stuffed than one of his delectable vongole origanate.

Over on the West Coast, in Seattle, the author Claire Dederer had discovered a similar phenomenon: a Little Free Library “absolutely crammed to its tiny rafters with books by and about” Allen, which she decided to gather as research. “An ill-gotten Woody Allen book was a book I hadn’t paid for — the perfect way to consume the art of someone whose morals you question,” she writes in her own new book, “Monsters: A Fan’s Dilemma,” a cross-disciplinary consideration of such polarizing figures, and of the ethics of a creative life.

“Everyone alive,” Dederer writes, “is either canceled or about to be canceled.” But she has no use for the term “cancel culture,” privileging, as it does, the person shamed by the red stamp of accusation, rather than the one who pipes up about wrongdoing. And she nonetheless wants to find a way to reconcile her appreciation of great art with the real-life misdeeds of its creators.

Expanding on a popular essay published in The Paris Review a month after the exposure of Harvey Weinstein’s sexual predation, “Monsters” sustains an essayistic, sometimes aphoristic tone throughout 250-odd pages. Dotted with details of her particular milieu — the ferryboat, the crepe shop, the rock show that leaves glitter in the eyelashes — “Monsters” is part memoir, part treatise and all treat. Dederer is continually trying — not in the adjectival sense, but as the present participle: showing us her thought process, correcting as she goes and experimenting with different forms.

She renders an argument with an unnamed tweedy “male writer” about Allen’s 1979 movie “Manhattan,” for example, as a “little play” set in the marble-lined restaurant at the Met Breuer (itself an echt “Manhattan” setting), observing “a clink of silverware around the room, as if the knives and forks were having another conversation, a clearer and cleaner conversation, underneath or above the meaty human rumble.”

Dederer, the “female writer” — and a nimble, witty one — has come to believe that the nonchalance with which Allen’s character dates a high schooler ruins the film, which has always faintly disturbed her, especially since the director left Mia Farrow for her daughter Soon-Yi Previn. The male writer takes the New Critical position that she should judge “Manhattan” just on aesthetics, and that it’s a masterpiece.

Woody Allen has already taken up too much space in this review. The so-called monster — a term that, handily, can denote success and size as well as deviance — has a way of doing that.

Dederer flips through an entire rogues’ gallery, which includes plenty of men yet also a surprising number of women: J.K. Rowling, of course, whose Harry Potter series had enraptured Dederer’s family before she spoke about transgender issues; but also Virginia Woolf, whose diaries were “pocked” with “flippant antisemitic remarks” though she was married to a Jew; Willa Cather, who dehumanized Black people in “My Ántonia”; Laura Ingalls Wilder, who dehumanized Native Americans in the “Little House” series; and Doris Lessing, who left two children behind when she moved from Rhodesia to London with the third.

“This is what female monstrousness looks like: abandoning the kids. Always,” declares Dederer, a mother of two still feeling guilty about a decade of drinking and a five-week retreat to Marfa, Texas. Here I’d argue with her (and I don’t think she’d mind; she is continually arguing with herself). Unless not having children, like Woolf, constitutes a kind of abandonment?

“Monster” turns out to be but one of several words the author carefully palpates, finding it “male, testicular, old world. It’s a hairy word, and has teeth.” It conjures childhood fear and fantasy, like the creatures in “Where the Wild Things Are,” whose author, Maurice Sendak, is in some quarters absurdly demonized, or the works of Roald Dahl: less absurdly demonized, for unflippant antisemitism. (“If we give up the antisemites,” remarks one of Dederer’s friends in what is actually kind of a Woody Allenish joke, “we’ll have to give up everyone.” )

“Am I a Monster?” Dederer titles one chapter, assessing her own relative rectitude. In the next breath, she assesses her own career — she has published well-received books on yoga and sex — “maybe I’m not monstrous enough.” Art requires selfishness; geniuses get a “hall pass” on having to conform to society’s expectations. If only one could keep the passionate, voracious part of monsterdom without leaving teeth marks in other people.

“Stain” is another piece of vocabulary Dederer finds useful, though Philip Roth’s “The Human Stain” is not among the many works analyzed here, and Roth is mentioned only in passing, despite the very interesting case of sexual misconduct accusations against his biographer that has jeopardized Roth’s legacy.

Maybe that’s because “biography,” to Dederer, seems not so much noble genre as ubiquitous nuisance, a “disrupter of my own pleasure”: just a set of personal details you can search for on that most monstrous of modern entities, the internet. “We swim in biography; we are sick with biography,” she writes. It “used to be something you sought out, yearned for, actively pursued. Now it falls on your head all day long.”

Corollary to the “monster,” more passive, is the “stain”: some ugliness coloring someone’s life that you don’t want to know, that nonetheless spreads and can ruin perception of his or her work. Stains seep through time, to the people who hurt the artist and the people the artist hurt, and in these days of heightened parasocial relationships, the people he or she hurts include us: the fan who knew too much.

Every fan’s shelf of scandal, the books  snatched furtively off the stoop, looks different. Dederer’s: light on Roth, laden with Vladimir Nabokov. Her exquisitely reasoned vindication of “Lolita” brought tears of gratitude to my eyes.

But I also found myself disagreeing with or questioning a lot, resisting her sweeping “we” (a pronoun she herself interrogates). I don’t think of the comedian Michael Richards’s 2006 racist tirade every time I catch glimpses of him bursting through the door on “Seinfeld.” (Should I?) Neither, presumably, does the hilarious young comedian Troy Bond, who regularly does a modernized parody of the show on TikTok.

I don’t think the word “ambition” attached to a woman is pejorative anymore. I don’t think women who complete their work — “finishers,” Dederer calls them — are in any way monstrous or comparable to male predators. They’re A students! Or just being professional.

And I definitely don’t think, as she asserts, that “pregnancy is the end of narrative.” This from someone who spends pages luxuriating guiltily in “Rosemary’s Baby,” trying to solve “the problem of Roman Polanski.”  What about John Updike’s “Couples”? (Don’t get me started on how The London Review of Books monsterized Updike, above Patricia Lockwood’s essay, as a “malfunctioning sex robot.”)

For an author who rightly shudders over the cheapening of the word “obsessed” to use the phrases “make work” — the new “make love”? — and “late capitalism” leaves me feeling, as Dederer would herself put it, “a little urpy.”

But, but … this is a book that looks boldly down the cliff at the roiling waters below and jumps right in, splashes around playfully, isn’t afraid to get wet. How refreshing.

    "3":""" On a recent sunny morning on the banks of the Adda River in northern Italy, schoolchildren on a class trip to Imbersago — the “Town of the Ferry of Leonardo da Vinci” — gathered next to a moored boat and listened as a guide explained how the flights of the river’s birds, the formations of its rocks and the workings of its ships inspired Leonardo’s genius.

“Why doesn’t it move?” one of the students interrupted, pointing to the ferry, which sat behind a chain and a sign reading, “Service suspended.” It looked like a deserted summer deck atop two rowboats.

“The water needs to be high enough for the current to move it,” answered Sara Asperti, 45. “Also, they’re looking for a new ferryman. So if any of you are interested.”

Since at least 500 years ago, when the opposing banks of the Adda belonged to the Duchy of Milan and the Republic of Venice, ferries have run on water currents and a taut rope above a narrow stretch of the river. Leonardo spent a lot of time in the area and sketched the motorless ferry around 1513. Later, the invention of the ferry, or its improvement, was attributed to him, though locals say no one knows for sure.

In the past century, reproductions of the original ferries have linked Italy’s Lecco and Bergamo Provinces, allowing knitwear factory workers to commute, a young Pope John XXIII to visit a favorite shrine and, more recently, tourists and cyclists to enjoy the nature paths and yellow fields of rapeseed.

But a year after Italy’s worst drought in seven decades — when much of Europe gasped for precipitation — a winter without much rain or snow has turned into a dry spring across the country’s north. In Piedmont, water tanks are already supplying a small mountain village with drinking water. The Po River valley, usually lush and rich in rice, is parched. In March, a member of Parliament brandished river stones that he collected from the dry Adige River to accuse Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of inaction.

“I’m not Moses,” she responded.

This month, the government established a task force to tackle the scarcity of rainfall, which has also hit the Adda, where swans glide on water so low that islands have emerged, rowboats are beached and the last of what the town calls “Leonardesque” ferries has become a stationary landmark.

“If it becomes a monument, or something static, it loses its meaning,” said Fabio Vergani, Imbersago’s mayor, as he sat on the ferry, big enough to hold three cars or scores of people, but now empty. The boat was a tourist draw and an economic engine, he said, but more important, it was “the family jewel of the town — we cannot be left without it.”

The painful case of the ferry, the mayor said, was “evidence of a global problem.” He continued: “It’s not science fiction. We are feeling the real effects. What was the problem of North Africa is maybe going to be the reality of southern Europe. A lack of rain and desertification of the territory.”

But some of the townspeople say an Italian problem more daunting than climate change is the real culprit for the ferry’s immobility since May.

“Bureaucracy,” said John Codara, who owns the gelato shop next to the ferry.

Since the last ferry operators left to run a more lucrative water taxi in Lake Como, no one has bid to take over the 4,500-euro-a-year concession, even though the town has thrown in a mountain bike rental as a deal sweetener.

The mayor says no one wants to operate the ferry because it cannot function with weak currents, and tried to explain as much to Mr. Codara in his cafe. But the gelato maker wasn’t buying it. After the mayor left, Mr. Codara, who fielded calls from interested locals — “You should see the hair on this guy,” he said, cupping the phone — remained convinced that the engineering of the ferry could handle low water.

“I mean Leonardo wasn’t a moron,” he said, under a framed picture of Leonardo. He demonstrated how the ferry worked on a small wooden model made by a local pensioner — “It’s to scale; it’s worth 500 euros,” or nearly $550, and argued that low water and weak currents meant operators required elbow grease to move it across the cable connecting the two banks.

“The force of the ferry is these,” Mr. Codara said, pointing at his biceps.

What they did not need was an advanced nautical degree, he said, as he marched out of his cafe and made a beeline for a sign honoring “The Human Face of the Ferry” and its pilots over the past century. “Harvard, Harvard, Harvard,” Mr. Codara said with derision as he pointed at the names. “They all went to Harvard.”

Roberto Spada, 75, whose father was one of those ferrymen, said he helped navigate the ferry as a 12-year-old and was interested in helping out the town by doing it again as a volunteer.

“I thought with my license I could do it,” Mr. Spada told the mayor as they leaned against other signs posted next to the ferry that featured both Leonardo’s sketch and an excerpt from Dante’s “Inferno” about Charon, “ferryman of the damned.”

A retired truck driver and president of the local fishing association — which has the ferry as its logo — Mr. Spada had a boating license but seemed bewildered as the mayor explained all of the certifications and bureaucratic hoops that needed to be jumped through to pilot the ferry.

“It’s a really long process,” said Mr. Vergani, the mayor.

In the meantime, the river is at one of its lowest depths in decades.

Volunteers tending to flower beds along the riverbank were finding the dirt so dry that they put down their hoes and used a leaf blower to tidy up. Cyclists stepped over the chain, their biking shoes clicking on the ferry platform, to commiserate about the low level of the river. One of them, Roberto Valsecchi, 63, who recalled crossing with his car on the ferry as a teenager, worried that the paltry snowfall on the ski slopes this winter meant “we will suffer this summer.”

Mr. Vergani worried that even if the skies opened, officials at Lake Como, which fed the river, would hoard the water and “keep the tap closed” to ensure the lake’s own survival. The situation looked bleak. The area’s hydroelectric plants had already started rationing water.

Giuseppina Di Paola, 64, paused from feeding geese to talk about how she used to take her mountain bike on the ferry, but now walked along the banks, where “I found a lot of dead fish.”

Flavio Besana, 70, an environmental guard of the local park, was spending his day off walking the centuries-old path beside the river. He pointed to the boulders considered the inspiration for the landscape in Leonardo’s “Virgin of the Rocks.”

“All of that is usually covered with water,” Mr. Besana said, pointing at the bottom of the boulder. “In 40 years, I’ve never seen the river like this.”

Near Imbersago’s small town center, the roundabout is adorned with a large wooden model of the ferry. The loss of the main attraction means tourism on the weekdays has slowed to a trickle. Valentino Riva, 66, whose father was a ferryman in the 1970s, ironed shirts in the dry-cleaning shop off the main square and recalled more buoyant days.

“There used to be people in the piazza,” he said, as the iron hissed. “Those times are finished.”

Evening fell and the day’s gentle breeze died down, leaving the river as still as a tar pit. Across the water, on the Bergamo side, Angela Maestroni, 64, sat with her husband next to Leonardo da Vinci Street and in front of the small port where the ferry no longer goes. They reminisced about commuting on the ferry, watched the birds and fretted about the future.

“It’s months that it doesn’t rain,” she said. “The summers are so much hotter. Last year, the sun burned everything.”

Just then, a light drizzle fell from the sky, pockmarking the river and spotting the ferry platform on the other shore. Then, just as suddenly, it stopped and the sky cleared.

“It’s two drops,” she said. “It’s not enough.”

    "4" : """ When Brian Maracle returned in his mid-40s to the Mohawk community near Toronto that he had left when he was just 5, he didn’t have a job and knew almost no one there.

But perhaps the biggest challenge facing him was that he neither spoke nor understood much Kanyen’keha, the Mohawk language. More than a century of attempts by Canada’s government to stamp out Indigenous cultures had left Mr. Maracle and many other Indigenous people without their languages.

Now, 30 years later, Mr. Maracle has become a champion of Mohawk, and is helping revive it and other Indigenous languages, both in Canada and elsewhere, through his transformation of teaching methods.

“I never studied linguistics, don’t have any teacher training, my parents weren’t speakers,” he said in his office at an adult language school he founded about two decades ago in his community, the Six Nations of the Grand River territory, southwest of Toronto. Yet, linguistics academic conferences now feature him as a speaker.
Innovative approaches like Mr. Maracle’s are crucial, experts say, to overcoming the suppression of Indigenous languages and cultures in Canada.

From the 19th century into the 1990s, thousands of Indigenous students were taken from their homes, sometimes by force, and placed into Canada’s residential schools system. There, they were forbidden from speaking their languages and from practicing their traditions in what a national commission later characterized as “cultural genocide.”

The system failed to entirely eradicate Indigenous languages, but its effect was nevertheless devastating for the 60 Indigenous languages found in Canada.

Today restoring Indigenous languages has been a component of Canada’s push for reconciliation with its Indigenous people, a top priority of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government. Four years ago, the government passed the Indigenous Languages Act, which formally recognizes the importance of these languages and requires the allocation of money — more than 700 million Canadian dollars to date — for teaching them.

But none of that was around when Mr. Maracle arrived at Six Nations, and the program that was available, he found, was ill-suited for adult students.

“Indigenous languages are extremely different from English,” said Ivona Kucerova, the director of the Center for Advanced Research in Experimental and Applied Linguistics at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. “But typically what you see is that the local Indigenous language teaching methodologies are designed to teach Western languages.”

Mr. Maracle said the problem with his first, unsuccessful lesson was that the instructors, generally Mohawk elders without training as language teachers, were tossing out “whole words.”

“They just expected by dropping a word on you and saying it louder that you’d somehow figure it out,” Mr. Maracle said. “They didn’t understand how the language really is structured.”

A small grant allowed Mr. Maracle and three other people from Six Nations to try to determine exactly what that structure was.

Mr. Maracle found the answer about 25 years ago in the office of David Kanatawakhon-Maracle, no direct relation, a lecturer at the Western University in London, Ontario.

“There were little bits of paper all over this big table,” Mr. Maracle recalled. The lecturer told Mr. Maracle words he had been longing to hear: “He said: ‘I think I’ve got a new way of teaching the language.’”

There were about 60 slips of paper on his office table, and they “were the Rosetta Stone of all the things that you need to be a competent beginning speaker,” Mr. Maracle said.

Kanyen’keha is a polysynthetic language, where a single word can function as an entire sentence. Those words are made up of morphemes, small elements that change their meaning depending on how they are combined.

The slips of paper contained the morphemes, which are the building blocks for the entire language.

“This was huge,” Mr. Maracle said.

Understanding that these elements were the key to unlocking the language was the breakthrough Mr. Maracle needed to attain fluency. But other students at the school he helped start in 1999 were still struggling. It became apparent that someone needed to build a curriculum and teaching program around the morphemes, including a color-coded system for grouping them, which Mr. Maracle did through trial and error.

One essential discovery was figuring out that learning Kanyen’keha requires “looking at the world with Mohawk language eyes,” he said.

In comparison with other languages, Kanyen’keha relies heavily on verbs. Objects are generally described by what they do. The word for “computer,” for example, roughly translates as “it brings things up.”

So its speakers, Mr. Maracle said, need to analyze the world in terms of action rather than objects.

“We don’t teach you how to say “pencil,” “chair,” ”shoe” for six months,” Mr. Maracle said. “Because the language is a verb-based language, the names of things are less grammatically important.”

Prof. Kucerova, the director of the linguistics center in Hamilton, regards Mr. Maracle as a linguist despite his lack of formal training. She said tests showed that his students emerged with a university-level fluidity in two years.

“I have never seen anyone else bring adult learners to that level of language, to be able to speak at this level after two years,” she said, adding that Mohawk ranks with Arabic in terms of difficulty for English-speaking students. “That’s really astonishing.”

“I became literally mesmerized by the extent of his work,” Prof. Kucerova said. “ He’s figured out this improbable, but linguistically extremely smart, method of delivering this radically different language to adults.”

Born in Detroit, Mr. Maracle spent most of his first five years in Six Nations, but later in his childhood lived in Buffalo and Rochester in New York, and Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, as his father, a carpenter, moved for work.

After graduating from Dartmouth College, he studied journalism and worked as a reporter for The Globe and Mail newspaper. He was also the host of an Indigenous radio program for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation before moving back to Six Nations.

Mr. Maracle, 76, recently retired from the language school he founded — Onkwawenna Kentyohkwa, or Our Language Society — but he remains active in a number of its programs.

The school has its offices in an Indigenous community services building in the village of Ohsweken, Ontario, the sprawling First Nation’s administrative center. It can afford to accept only about a dozen students a year; its first grants from the federal government arrived just in 2021. Before then, it was largely financed by the community.

There are no concrete figures of current Kanyen’keha speakers in the area, but the local branch of the Royal Bank of Canada, Canada’s largest financial institution, now has signs in Kanyen’keha and employees who speak the language. Signs in the language around the community warn motorists to not text and drive.

The school’s students have included Marc Miller, the current federal minister of Indigenous relations, who after some part time studies, became the first lawmaker to address Canada’s Parliament in an Indigenous language since Confederation in 1867.

Mr. Maracle said the most important difference he has seen is that Kanyen’keha is no longer spoken only by older people, but used more often by the young, in their homes, with their immediate families and in everyday situations.

“I think people are finally coming around to the realization that the public schools and technology are not going to save our languages,” he said, adding, “You have to enable young adults to become speakers so that they can raise children as first language speakers.”

    "5" : """ Oh, Possums, Dame Edna is no more.

To be unflinchingly precise, Barry Humphries, the Australian-born actor and comic who for almost seven decades brought that divine doyenne of divadom, Dame Edna Everage, to delirious, dotty, disdainful Dadaist life, died on Saturday in Sydney. He was 89.

His death was confirmed by the hospital where he had spent several days after undergoing hip surgery. In a tribute message posted on Twitter, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia praised Mr. Humphries as “a great wit, satirist, writer and an absolute one-of-kind.”

A stiletto-heeled, stiletto-tongued persona who might well have been the spawn of a ménage à quatre involving Oscar Wilde, Salvador Dalí, Auntie Mame and Miss Piggy, Dame Edna was not so much a character as a cultural phenomenon, a force of nature trafficking in wicked, sequined commentary on the nature of fame.

For generations after the day she first sprang to life on the Melbourne stage, Dame Edna reigned, bewigged, bejeweled and bejowled, as one of the longest-lived characters to be channeled by a single performer. She toured worldwide in a series of solo stage shows and was ubiquitous on television in the United States, Britain, Australia and elsewhere.

A master improviser (many of Dame Edna’s most stinging barbs were ad-libbed) with a face like taffy, Mr. Humphries was widely esteemed as one of the world’s foremost theatrical clowns.

“I’ve only seen one man have power over an audience like that,” the theater critic John Lahr told him, after watching Dame Edna night after night in London. “My father.” Mr. Lahr’s father was the great stage and cinematic clown Bert Lahr.

Mr. Humphries conceived Edna in 1955 as Mrs. Norm Everage, typical Australian housewife. “Everage,” after all, is Australian for “average.”

Housewife, Superstar, National Treasure

But Edna soon became a case study in exorbitant amour propre, lampooning suburban pretensions, political correctness and the cult of celebrity, and acquiring a damehood along the way. A “housewife-superstar,” she called herself, upgrading the title in later years to “megastar” and, still later, to “gigastar.”

In Britain, where Mr. Humphries had long made his home, Dame Edna was considered a national treasure, a paragon of performance art long before the term was coined.

In the United States, she starred in a three-episode series, “Dame Edna’s Hollywood,” a mock celebrity talk show broadcast on NBC in the early 1990s, and was a frequent guest on actual talk shows.

She performed several times on Broadway, winning Mr. Humphries a special Tony Award, as well as Drama Desk and Theater World Awards, for “Dame Edna: The Royal Tour,” his 1999 one-person show.

In her stage and TV shows, written largely by Mr. Humphries, Dame Edna typically made her entrance tottering down a grand staircase (Mr. Humphries was more than six feet tall) in a tsunami of sequins, her hair a bouffant violet cloud (she was “a natural wisteria,” she liked to say), her evening gown slit to the thigh to reveal Mr. Humphries’s surprisingly good legs, her body awash in jewels, her eyes agape behind sprawling rhinestone glasses (“face furniture,” she called them).

Addressing the audience, she delivered her signature greeting, “Hellooooo, Possums!”

By turns tender and astringent, Dame Edna called audience members “possums” often. She also called them other things, as when, leaning across the footlights, she would address a woman in the front row in a confiding, carrying voice: “I know, dear. I used to make my own clothes, too.”

Performances concluded with Dame Edna flinging hundreds of gladioli into the crowd, no mean feat aerodynamically. “Wave your gladdies, Possums!” she exhorted audience members who caught them, and the evening would end, to music, with a mass valedictory swaying.

Between the “Hellooooo” and the gladdies, Dame Edna’s audiences were treated to a confessional monologue deliciously akin to finding oneself stranded in a hall of vanity mirrors.

There was commentary on her husband and children (“I made a decision: I put my family last”); her beauty regimen (“Good self-esteem is very important. I look in the mirror and say, ‘Edna, you are gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous’”); and the constellation of luminaries who routinely sought her counsel, among them Queen Elizabeth II and her family. (“I’ve had to change my telephone number several times to stop them ringing me.”)

Dame Edna’s TV shows were often graced by actual celebrity guests, including Zsa Zsa Gabor, Charlton Heston, Sean Connery, Robin Williams and Lauren Bacall.

They came in for no less of a drubbing than the audience did, starting with the inaugural affront, the affixing of immense name tags to their lapels — for eclipsed by the light of gigastardom so close at hand, who among us would not be reduced to anonymity?

“Chuck,” Mr. Heston’s name tag read. Ms. Gabor received two: a “Zsa” for the right shoulder and a “Zsa” for the left.

A few pleasantries were exchanged before Dame Edna moved in for the kill.

“You’ve had nine hits this year,” she purred fawningly at the singer-songwriter Michael Bolton on one of her British TV shows. “On your website.”

Turning to the audience after delivering a particularly poisonous insult, she would ooze, “I mean that in the most caring way.”

Those guests who emerged relatively unscathed had the savvy to take Dame Edna at face value and interact with her as though she were real. The moment he donned those rhinestone glasses, Mr. Humphries often said, Dame Edna became real to him too, an entirely separate law unto herself.

‘I Wish I’d Thought of That’

“I’m, as it were, in the wings, and she’s onstage,” he explained in a 2015 interview with Australian television. “And every now and then she says something extremely funny, and I stand there and think, ‘I wish I’d thought of that.’”

But the truly funny thing, Possums, is that when Mr. Humphries first brought Dame Edna to life, he intended her to last only a week or so. What was more, she was meant to have been played by the distinguished actress Zoe Caldwell.

Mr. Humphries created a string of other characters over the years, notably the boorish, bibulous Australian cultural attaché Sir Les Patterson. But it was Dame Edna, the outlandish aunt who engenders adoration and mortification in equal measure, who captivated the public utterly — despite the fact that in later years, her mortification-inducing lines sometimes landed her, and her creator, in trouble.

So fully did Mr. Humphries animate Edna that he was at continued pains to point out that he was neither a female impersonator in the conventional sense nor a cross-dresser in any sense.

“Mr. Humphries, do you ever have to take your children aside and explain to them why you like to wear women’s clothes?” an American interviewer once asked him.

“If I were an actor playing Hamlet,” he replied, “would I have to take my children aside and say I wasn’t really Danish?’”

By all accounts far more erudite than Dame Edna — he was an accomplished painter, bibliophile and art collector — Mr. Humphries, in a sustained act of self-protection, always spoke of her in the third person.

She did likewise. “My manager,” she disdainfully called him. (She also called Mr. Humphries “a money-grubbing little slug” and accused him of embezzling her fortune. He did, it must be said, cash a great many of her checks.)

But as dismissive of her creator as Dame Edna was, she rallied to his aid when he very likely needed her most: after years of alcoholism culminated in stays in psychiatric hospitals and at least one brush with the law.

‘I Hated Her’

John Barry Humphries was born in Kew, a Melbourne suburb, on Feb. 17, 1934. His father, Eric, was a prosperous builder; his mother, Louisa, was a homemaker.

From his earliest childhood in Camberwell, a more exclusive suburb, he felt oppressed by the bourgeois conformism that enveloped his parents and their circle, and depressed by his mother’s cold suburban propriety.

Dame Edna was a response to those forces.

“I invented Edna because I hated her,” Mr. Humphries was quoted as saying in Mr. Lahr’s book “Dame Edna Everage and the Rise of Western Civilization: Backstage With Barry Humphries” (1992). “I poured out my hatred of the standards of the little people of their generation.”

Dame Edna emerged when the young Mr. Humphries, under the sway of Dadaism, was performing with a repertory company based at the University of Melbourne; he had dropped out of the university two years before.

On long bus tours, he entertained his colleagues with the character of Mrs. Norm Everage — born Edna May Beazley in Wagga Wagga, Australia, sometime in the 1930s — an ordinary housewife who had found sudden acclaim after winning a nationwide competition, the Lovely Mother Quest.

Unthinkable as it seems, Edna was dowdy then, given to mousy brown hair and pillbox hats. But she was already in full command of the arsenal of bourgeois bigotries that would be a hallmark of her later self.

For a revue by the company in December 1955, Mr. Humphries wrote a part for Edna, earmarked for Ms. Caldwell, an Australian contemporary. But when she proved too busy to oblige, he donned a dress and played it himself. After Edna proved a hit with Melbourne audiences, he performed the character elsewhere in the country.

By the end of the 1950s, hoping to make a career as a serious actor, Mr. Humphries had moved to London, where Edna met with little enthusiasm and was largely shelved. (She blamed Mr. Humphries ever after for her lack of early success there.)

Mr. Humphries played Mr. Sowerberry, the undertaker, in the original West End production of the musical “Oliver!” in 1960, and reprised the role when the show came to Broadway in 1963.

But though he worked steadily during the ’60s, he was also in the fierce grip of alcoholism. Stays in psychiatric hospitals, he later said, were of no avail.

His nadir came in 1970, when he awoke in a Melbourne gutter to find himself under arrest.

With a doctor’s help, Mr. Humphries became sober soon afterward; he did not take a drink for the rest of his life. He dusted off Dame Edna and, little by little, de-dowdified her. By the late ’70s, with celebrity culture in full throttle, she had given him international renown and unremitting employment.

Edna did not seduce every critic. Reviewing her first New York stage show, the Off Broadway production “Housewife! Superstar!!,” in The New York Times in 1977, Richard Eder called it “abysmal.”

Nor did Edna’s resolute lack of political correctness always stand her, or Mr. Humphries, in good stead. In February 2003, writing an advice column as Dame Edna in Vanity Fair, he replied to a reader’s query about whether to learn Spanish.

“Who speaks it that you are really desperate to talk to?” Dame Edna’s characteristically caustic response read. “The help? Your leaf blower? Study French or German, where there are at least a few books worth reading, or, if you’re American, try English.”

A public furor ensued, led by the Mexican-born actress Salma Hayek, who appeared on the magazine’s cover that month. Vanity Fair discontinued Dame Edna’s column not long afterward.

In an interview with The Times in 2004, Mr. Humphries was unrepentant.

“The people I offended were minorities with no sense of humor, I fear,” he said. “When you have to explain the nature of satire to somebody, you’re fighting a losing battle.”

Mr. Humphries drew further ire after a 2016 interview with the British newspaper The Telegraph in which he denounced political correctness as a “new puritanism.” In the same interview, he described people who transition from male to female as “mutilated” men, and Caitlyn Jenner in particular as “a publicity-seeking ratbag.”

Sailing Above the Fray

Dame Edna, for her part, appeared to sail imperviously through. She returned to Broadway in 2004 for the well-received show “Dame Edna: Back With a Vengeance” and in 2010 with “All About Me,” a revue that also starred the singer and pianist Michael Feinstein.

As herself — it was she, and not Mr. Humphries, who was credited — Dame Edna played the recurring character Claire Otoms (the name is an anagram for “a sitcom role”), an outré lawyer, on the Fox TV series “Ally McBeal.”

Under his own name, Mr. Humphries appeared as the Great Goblin in “The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey” (2012); as the voice of Bruce, the great white shark, in “Finding Nemo” (2003); and in other pictures.

Mr. Humphries’s books include the memoirs “More Please” (1992) and “My Life as Me” (2002) and the novel “Women in the Background” (1995). He was named a Commander of the British Empire in 2007.

Dame Edna also wrote several books, among them “Dame Edna’s Bedside Companion” (1983) and the memoir “My Gorgeous Life” (1989).

Mr. Humphries’s first marriage, to Brenda Wright, ended in divorce, as did his second, to Rosalind Tong, and his third, to Diane Millstead. He had two daughters, Tessa and Emily, from his marriage to Ms. Tong, and two sons, Oscar and Rupert, from his marriage to Ms. Millstead.

The Sydney Morning Herald reported that his survivors include his wife of 30 years, Lizzie Spender, the daughter of the British poet Stephen Spender, as well as his children and 10 grandchildren.

Mr. Humphries continued to perform until last year, when he toured Britain (as himself) with a one-man show, “The Man Behind the Mask.” He returned to Australia in December for Christmas.

Dame Edna’s husband, Norm, a chronic invalid “whose prostate,” she often lamented, “has been hanging over me for years,” died long ago. Her survivors include an adored son, Kenny, who designed all her gowns; a less adored son, Bruce; and a despised daughter, the wayward Valmai. (“She steals things. Puts them in her pantyhose. Particularly frozen chickens when she’s in a supermarket.”)

Another daughter, Lois, was abducted as an infant by a “rogue koala,” a subject Dame Edna could bring herself to discuss with interviewers only rarely.

Though the child was never seen again, to the end of her life Dame Edna never gave up hope she would be found.

“I’m looking,” she told NPR in 2015. “Every time I pass a eucalyptus tree I look up.”

Dear readers,

It was the day I found myself weeping over a purse during the final minutes of “Sex and the City 2,” miles above Omaha, that I came to truly believe in the powers of mild altitude hypoxia. This is, of course, the phenomenon in which the reduced rates of oxygen in flight may result in heightened emotional responses — and I love it. For those of us who find it hard to turn off our brains, whose entire viewing experience can be ruined by a single anachronism or grammatical error, who are tiresome even to ourselves — well, suspending that hectoring critic is a vacation in itself.

And it’s true for books, too! On a recent red-eye, it made sense to sob at the heart-rending conclusion of “Giovanni’s Room”; never has claustrophobia been more freeing than in James Baldwin’s precision-cut classic. But crying when Monroe Boston Strause finally hits upon the formula for chiffon filling in his 1939 memoir, “Pie Marches On”? It may have been cathartic, but it was time for a melatonin. (“Sex and the City 2” is, after all, frame for frame one of the worst movies ever made.)

These books hold up at any altitude.

This Portuguese family-saga-meets-coming-of-age-drama-meets-romance by one of the greatest of the 19th-century realists (just ask Zola!) is incredibly, improbably fun. José Maria de Eça de Queirós was prolific, and all of his work is characterized by a keen eye for human folly and material detail — but this novel is undoubtedly my favorite. Long? Yes, but it’s a page-turner. And Margaret Jull Costa’s 2007 translation renders it a pure bedtime pleasure, its heft a comfort rather than a burden.

As if the multigenerational story of shocking marriages, changing Lisbon mores, high-society affairs and arrogant young gentlemen getting taken down a few pegs were not enough, “The Maias” also features incredibly vivid descriptions of the era’s décor. To wit: “At the end of the corridor lay Alfonso’s study, furnished like a prelate’s chambers in red damasks. Everything in the room — the solid rosewood desk, the low shelves made from carved oak, the sober opulence of the bindings on the books — combined to create an austere air of studious peace, reinforced by a painting attributed to Rubens.”

Roffman’s was the first biography to look closely at the early life of the famously private Ashbery — who, according to conventional wisdom, made a point of avoiding the autobiographical in his poetry. This fluent, engrossing portrait makes a persuasive argument for the importance of youthful influences: the upstate farm and verdant landscape that show up, elliptically, in so much of the poet’s work; the books and music that introduced the precocious teenager to the larger world of art; the death of his beloved brother.

Roffman knew Ashbery, and had access to his childhood journals, his juvenilia and his Deerfield and college archives, so the result is intimate and detailed. She ends the book when Ashbery is in his late 20s and on the verge of success, but that gives us plenty of delicious glimpses into the electric early days of the New York School: his charismatic best friend Frank O’Hara, the surly Beats, the artists and dancers and avant-garde musicians, many of them queer, of bohemian New York — plus O’Hara’s weird Harvard roommate, the seemingly ubiquitous “Ted” Gorey.

It’s a must-read for Ashbery enthusiasts, but you don’t need to love or even like poetry to appreciate this story of growing up in an era when artistic potential felt limitless and the life of the mind was as vivid (almost) as that of Greenwich Village evenings.

Why don’t you …

Do a little spring cleaning? As a penniless young poet in 1970s New York, Bob Rosenthal signed on with a temp agency cleaning houses. But houses, of course, mean people. And people mean feelings, relationships, the unexpected. Rosenthal’s resulting book, “Cleaning Up New York,” is a deeply humane, often hilarious and ultimately moving little treatise on intimacy. As to cleaning tips? Dirt always wins.

Exercise your green thumb? I don’t remember how “The Flower Shop,” a photo book about the gorgeous Viennese florist Blumenkraft, came into my life. But it’s an idiosyncratic commentary on what the subtitle itself terms (endearingly) “charm, grace, beauty, tenderness in a commercial context.” Think of it as a documentary in book form: a glimpse into the life of a business and the people who have devoted their lives to it.

Pull yourself together, damn it? From the legendary grande dame decorator Dorothy Draper — whom one suspects subscribed to the “brisk walk” school of therapeutic treatment — comes a quote I have pinned above my desk for those many days when I’m tempted to be antisocial: “‘The Will to be Dreary’ is a morose little imp which whispers to us that something which we know would be fun would be too much trouble, will take too much time, is too expensive and probably wouldn’t be as amusing after all as just now you think it would be. Now don’t listen to that voice. Tune it out.”

    "7" : """ The Irish podcaster David Chambers spends his days‌ in an exceptionally drab office. A room so drab it is striking. In a recent interview via Zoom, he was dressed to match, in a white T-shirt and plain black hoodie. The only noteworthy thing onscreen was ‌an orange and white plastic bag that Chambers wore over his head. His green eyes, thick eyebrows‌ and beard could be seen through the bag’s holes, but the rest of his face was obscured.

Although they don’t know what he looks like underneath the mask, most people in Ireland know Chambers, 37, by his pseudonym “Blindboy Boatclub,” or, more often, just “Blindboy.” He is best known as the host of “The Blindboy Podcast,” a weekly show in which he discusses eclectic topics, like the unlikely benefits of lion urine or the link between heavy metal and futurism, and tells personal anecdotes that unspool like short stories. He addresses topics like mental health that Irish news media outlets rarely touch, and brings a millennial sensibility to political discussions. His register is earnest and intellectual, but also funny and down-to-earth.

“The Blindboy Podcast,” which Chambers started in 2017, regularly attracts 700,000 to one million monthly listeners, according to Acast, the company that hosts it. Six years on, it is something of a cultural phenomenon in Ireland, and increasingly overseas. Chambers has appeared on some of Ireland’s most popular television chat shows, and President Michael D. Higgins was a guest on a recent podcast episode. Acast says that more than half of the podcast’s listeners are outside Ireland, and Chambers has toured live shows in Canada, Thailand, Spain and Belgium.

Before the podcast, Chambers’s career took several surprising turns. He first used the alias “Blindboy” while making prank calls to radio call-in shows, which earned him some notoriety in Ireland and a cult following there. With a friend and fellow prank caller, Chambers formed a comedy hip-hop duo called the Rubberbandits that had a viral hit in 2010. That track, “Horse Outside,” reached No. 2 in the Irish charts, and Chambers maneuvered that success into hosting comedy shows on MTV and the British station Channel 4.

The plastic bag on Chambers’s head, which dates back to the beginning, was “part of a performance to challenge solemnity in whatever I do,” he said. But it also guarantees anonymity: He is grateful to be spared some of the trappings of fame, particularly in a small country, he said.

“Being an Irish celebrity in itself is a bit cringe — unless you’re Paul Mescal, like, a proper celebrity,” he said. “I don’t want that level of cringe. Being Blindboy in real life would be a very, very cringe existence.”

Anonymity also affords ‌Chambers ‌the freedom to talk candidly on the podcast about his personal struggles with mental health. He tells funny, relatable anecdotes about his experiences with, and efforts to manage, depression, anxiety and agoraphobia. One such episode is titled “Why I’m Going Back to Therapy.”

This openness resonates with his mostly millennial and Gen Z audience. Leah Moloney, a 27-year-old Irish fan who started listening regularly during the pandemic, said in an interview that she found the mental health content “really helpful at that time, because he was speaking really openly, and I certainly felt less alone.”

She added that when Chambers told listeners last April, in an episode called “Intrapersonally Speaking,” that he had been diagnosed with autism, that had helped her adapt to an A.D.H.D. diagnosis she had recently received. “I’ve been inspired by him to be open,” she said, adding that she now posts regularly about her experience of A.D.H.D. on TikTok.

Issues like these are still relatively under-discussed in the Irish news media and society, and Chambers’s fans seem to welcome his candor. He gets “thousands and thousands” of social media messages about mental health, he said, but he could never deal with interactions like those in person. “If I didn’t have the bag,” Chambers said, “I’d stop talking about mental health‌.”

On other episodes, Chambers talks frankly about an economic climate that he says has infantilized his generation. Ireland is in the grips of a rental crisis caused by a severe housing shortage; Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said last month that the country of five million people had 250,000 too few homes. And it is Ireland’s millennials who are worst affected, Chambers said. “The media will call a 40-year-old a young person. I’m in my late 30s and I refuse: I’m middle-aged,” he added. “If you call it ‘middle-aged people can’t get housing,’ it’s obvious there is a problem.”

Chambers said he saw a generational divide, too, in the way that the news media in the Republic of Ireland talks about Northern Irish politics. On the podcast, Chambers addresses millennial perspectives that he says news outlets in the South fail to reflect.

Sinn Fein, a political party that fields candidates on both sides of the border, has had a recent resurgence of popularity in the South, where it was once unpopular because it was associated with the Irish Republican Army. Chambers said the Irish news media continued to draw links between the party and terrorism. But for people born after the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that brokered peace in the North, he said, Sinn Fein lawmakers were “the ones who are doing something different.” (He added that he did not endorse any political parties.)

Several popular Instagram accounts attest to this growing interest in Northern Irish politics among young people in the Republic. One of these, called Tanistry, posts plainly illustrated slides explaining historical events such as the Good Friday Agreement, or the Bloody Sunday massacre of 1972, and relating them to contemporary politics. Andrew Clarke, a 27-year-old college student from Belfast who runs the account, said that there had been a culture of “mystification” around Northern Irish politics and that he was “trying to make it digestible,” adding that more than half of the account’s followers were aged 24 to 35, with the highest concentrations in Dublin and Belfast.

The most interesting thing about the success of “The Blindboy Podcast,” though, is the esoteric and seemingly random nature of many episodes. Where it is common for popular millennial podcasts to attract interest via culture war topics — deliberately courting controversy, or talking mostly about trending social justice issues — Chambers has garnered a huge audience mostly by talking about things that nobody is really supposed to care about.

One episode traces the history of offices back to monks; many others address arcane elements of Irish mythology. “Topographia Hibernica,” a short story collection by Chambers that will be published in Ireland and Britain in November, explores these themes further, looking at the links between mythology and colonialism.

Talking to him can feel like skittering around a galaxy of Wikipedia wormholes (in a good way). There is an infectious quality to his enthusiasm for a seemingly endless, and frequently bizarre, catalog of interests and passions.

Chambers said he put the success of “The Blindboy Podcast” down to the fact he only ever talks about his genuine interests, something he thinks the audience can sense. “I’ll never speak about something just to get listens,” he said.

    "8" : """ Two years into a surge of book bans across the United States, Florida is a hot spot in the clash over what reading material is appropriate for children, with laws that have greatly expanded the state’s ability to restrict books.

Historically, books were challenged one at a time. As bans in schools and libraries began increasing nationally in 2021, efforts were largely local, led by a parent or a group. But over the past year, access to books, particularly those touching on race, gender or sexual orientation, became increasingly politicized. With that came an increase in legislation and regulations in some states and school districts that affected which books libraries could offer.

The shift is particularly evident in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican-controlled Legislature and a rapidly growing network of conservative groups aligned to pass three state laws last year aimed, at least in part, at reading or educational materials. Among the books removed from circulation in one of the state’s school districts are Toni Morrison’s “Beloved,” and Margaret Atwood’s “The Handmaid’s Tale.”

The policies have energized Mr. DeSantis’s supporters and are part of the platform from which he is expected to run for president.
Proponents of the restrictions say their aims are to protect students from inappropriate materials and to give parents more control over their children’s education. In focusing on “parents’ rights,” Mr. DeSantis is trying to build on the popularity he amassed when he resisted Covid-19 restrictions, particularly in schools. The push is a signature part of the conservatism he is showcasing in Florida. His Parental Rights in Education law, for example, constrains instruction on gender and sexuality, which has led some districts to remove books with L.G.B.T.Q. characters.

Some teachers and librarians say the policies are vague, with imprecise language and broad requirements, leading to some confusion. But they are trying to comply. Violation of the law could be a third-degree felony; in general, such crimes are punishable by up to five years in prison

In January, when the new guidelines went into effect, some teachers removed or covered up books that had not been vetted by certified media specialists, whose approval is now legally required. Others are not ordering titles that could draw complaints. Some educators emptied shelves or pulled collections until the titles could be reassessed.

“It is a whole new level of fear,” said Kathleen Daniels, the president of the Florida Association for Media in Education, a professional organization for school librarians and media educators. “There are books that are not being selected because they have been challenged.”

Florida ranks second, behind Texas, as the state with the highest number of book removals, according to a report released on Thursday from the free-speech organization PEN America, which tracked book bans in schools from July 1 to Dec. 31 of 2022. But PEN said that Florida’s broad, state-level approach, with “wholesale bans” that restrict access to “untold numbers of books in classrooms and school libraries,” made the true extent of book removals in the state difficult to quantify.

Many of the new restrictions come from a law passed last year that requires trained media specialists to evaluate each school book to ensure it is age-appropriate and free of “pornographic” content. The law also requires schools to keep a searchable online database of the books in their libraries and classrooms.

Proposed legislation goes further. In March, the Florida House passed a bill that could require schools to remove a book promptly based on a single complaint from a parent or county resident that the book depicted sexual conduct. Under the proposed bill, the book would remain unavailable until the complaint was resolved.

Two other laws are contributing to book bans in Florida schools. The Stop WOKE Act prohibits instruction that could make students feel guilty or responsible for the past actions of other members of their race. The Parents Rights in Education law prohibits classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in some elementary grades; a state rule is expected to expand the restrictions through 12th grade.

Efforts by Florida’s 67 public school districts to put the new regulations into practice have been uneven and often chaotic. Some districts have taken no major action. Others enacted blanket removals that essentially gutted libraries.

Earlier this year, soon after the new guidelines for libraries were issued in January, some districts moved quickly to comply. In Duval County, home to Jacksonville, the public school district restricted access to more than a million titles, keeping them out of students’ hands until they were vetted by specialists. In Manatee County, on Florida’s Gulf Coast, some teachers boxed up their classroom libraries or covered their shelves. Officials in Martin County, on the state’s Atlantic Coast, removed around 150 books from school circulation in January and February, including John Green’s “Looking for Alaska,” and James Patterson’s “Maximum Ride,” a series of sci-fi adventure books for readers ages 10 and up, which were pulled from elementary schools.

Mr. Patterson, who lives in Palm Beach, Fla., called the removal of his books “frightening.”

“When you can take a mainstream series like ‘Maximum Ride’ and take it off the shelves,” he said, “it shows that no one is safe.” A county spreadsheet gave no specific reason for the series’ removal.

Training material advised media specialists to consider how they would feel reading passages from the book in question aloud. “If you would not be comfortable reading the material in a public setting,” said a slide show by the state’s Department of Education, “then you should lean towards not making the material available in a school library for children.”

Jennifer Pippin leads a local chapter of the group Moms for Liberty in Florida and was on the Department of Education panel that helped design the training materials. She said books that had been removed from school libraries in the state should not be considered “banned” because they remained available at public libraries and in bookstores.

Young people in a school library might happen to pick up a book that contains a graphic rape scene, she said, because they enjoyed other volumes in the same series. Or a child interested in penguins might open a book about a penguin family with two dads. But “it may not be appropriate for them per their parents’ standards,” she said. “With no instruction or parental guidance, some of these things could indeed be harmful.”

In Duval County, the school district asked the district’s 54 media specialists in January to begin reviewing the more than 1.6 million titles. Unapproved books, elementary teachers were told, had to be covered or set aside.

About 25,000 books had cleared the review process as of early this month. The ongoing process has left Duval County’s more than 129,000 students with access to only a tiny fraction of available titles, critics said.

“Our books are being shadow-banned,” said Nina Perez, a Jacksonville resident and a director for MomsRising, an advocacy organization opposing the restrictions. “They get mired in an administrative process.”
Tracy Pierce, a Duval school district spokesman, said in an email last month that the actions had followed guidance from the state’s Department of Education. At no time should classrooms have been without reading material, he said, since students still had access to approved books and collections. He acknowledged that “a small number of principals did close or overly restrict” media centers briefly and were advised to restore access.

Mr. DeSantis has reacted aggressively to criticism that public schools are banning books. He dismissed news reports that Duval County schools had removed a title about the baseball player Roberto Clemente as “a joke,” accusing critics of “manufacturing” a narrative about book bans.

The book, which addresses the racism that Mr. Clemente faced, was removed and then restored in February after a review. Last month, the state’s education commissioner named the title, “Roberto Clemente: Pride of the Pittsburgh Pirates” by Jonah Winter, a book of the month for third through fifth grades.

At a news conference last month, Mr. DeSantis stood behind a sign that read “Exposing the Book Ban HOAX” and said that the state was trying to protect children from pornographic material. The event began with a presentation on books reported to districts for removal — including “Gender Queer,” by Maia Kobabe and “Flamer,” by Mike Curato — and highlighted scenes about sexual contact and masturbation.

“This idea of a book ban in Florida, that somehow they don’t want books in the library — that’s a hoax,” Mr. DeSantis said. “And that’s really a nasty hoax, because it’s a hoax in service of trying to pollute and sexualize our children.”

Critics in the state are pushing back. In March, Democracy Forward, an advocacy organization, filed a lawsuit with the state on behalf of the Florida Education Association and other groups challenging the rules, arguing that they censor educators, limit students’ access to books and harm public education. The Florida Freedom to Read Project organized a rally in Tallahassee last month with authors and free speech activists to protest censorship.

After Brian Covey, a substitute teacher in Jacksonville, posted a video in January of empty library shelves at a Duval County middle school, a reporter asked Mr. DeSantis about it. The governor called the video a “fake narrative.” Mr. Covey, who lost his job shortly after, said that he was troubled that Mr. DeSantis and the school district tried to delegitimize what he had documented.

The fact that they called it a false narrative, Mr. Covey said, “tells me that they have no intention of saying, ‘We made a mistake.’”

    "9" : """ Lucinda Williams, the Grammy-winning 70-year-old songwriter, was born in Lake Charles, La. Her grandfathers were both preachers; one was a civil rights advocate. Her father, Miller Williams, was an award-winning poet. Her mother loved music and played the piano. Williams grew up in Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, Utah, Chile and Mexico. On paper, it was an ideal upbringing for the artist she became: a nomadic touring musician whose songs draw on deep Southern roots, using matter-of-fact imagery to conjure tempestuous emotions.

But her pedigree didn’t make her life fall neatly into place, as Williams recalls in her memoir, “Don’t Tell Anybody the Secrets I Told You.” “I’ve held back from talking about my childhood over the decades of my life,” she notes. “I’ve written songs about it instead.”

Williams’s mother was sexually abused as a child, she writes, and lived with schizophrenia and alcoholism. Her poet-professor father was a mentor and protector, but he also had a temper. Williams’s parents divorced after her father took up with one of his teenage students.

In the title song of her best-selling album, “Car Wheels on a Gravel Road,” Williams sings about being a “Child in the back seat ’bout four or five years/Lookin’ out the window, little bit of dirt mixed with tears.” When her father first heard it, he told Williams that she was that crying little girl; until then, Williams hadn’t realized she was writing about herself.

Williams’s memoir is as flinty, earthy and plain-spoken as her songs. She reveals the autobiographical underpinnings of some of her darkest lyrics, but she also tells a larger tale: of artistic determination battling personal insecurity; of misjudging and being misjudged by men and by the music business; and of steadfastly holding her own.

She doesn’t give in: not on a trendy remix, not on her album cover photos, not on her instincts. She can handle being called difficult or “insane” even though, she admits, “There are times when I can bring an extra layer of unpredictable emotion to a situation that is already tough to begin with.” The lasting results are in her songs.

Williams envisioned life as a musician soon after she picked up a guitar. She started performing folk songs in her teens. But even as she honed her own songwriting and built local reputations — in Texas and then in Los Angeles — she worked day jobs well into her 30s. Major labels rejected her, again and again, as being “too country for rock” but “too rock for country.”

From the beginning — two low-budget Folkways albums she made in 1979 and 1980 — Williams sang about elemental subjects: desire, sorrow, love, traveling, survival, death. Some of her songs are kiss-offs; some offer regrets; some are elegies; some are takedowns. They’re always grounded in homely details. In “Hot Blood,” a bluesy outpouring of female lust, she sings about feeling “a cold chill” as she watches a guy just “fixin’ your flat with a tire iron.”

It took an English punk label, Rough Trade, to release “Lucinda Williams,” her 1988 breakthrough album. A decade later, “Car Wheels on a Gravel Road” marked her commercial peak. But recording that album, she recalls in the memoir, was lengthy and fraught. Making records, she writes, “can test the limits and boundaries of everyone involved. I now understand that is normal.”

Getting the sound Williams wanted on “Car Wheels” led to the breakup of her longtime band and clashes with two producers. Then contractual tangles delayed the release of the finished album for two years. Williams also nixed a video concept from the director Paul Schrader, deciding, “He was just another guy trying to impose his vision on a female artist. ‘Car Wheels’ did fine without a video.”

Throughout her book, Williams recognizes her own appetites and mistakes. She writes about suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder and bouts of depression, and she recognizes her weakness for the kind of boyfriend she calls “a poet on a motorcycle,” guys who often turned out to be cheaters, addicts or worse.

She came through anyway. “That relationship was done, but I got a good song out of it,” she writes about one romantic debacle. Williams has been married since 2009 to her manager, producer and songwriting collaborator, Tom Overby.

Although Williams finished her book in 2022, it doesn’t mention her 2020 stroke; she can no longer play guitar. But she returned to touring in 2021 and persists in writing songs; she’s releasing a new album in June. Her memoir shows how deep that grit runs.

    "11" : """ Onstage at Webster Hall in New York last fall, Jessie Ware glided through choreography in a faux-fur-trimmed turquoise caftan, and later swung a black whip while singing the title track from her 2020 disco LP, “What’s Your Pleasure?” Backstage, however, was a different vibe.

“I had a bat mitzvah lesson in my dressing room,” the British singer and songwriter, 38, said in an interview last month. “That’s when your worlds are colliding.”

Ware has become an expert at hilariously exposing the gap between the luxuriousness of her music and the realities of life as a touring musician, a mother of three young children, a cookbook author and a successful podcaster (“Table Manners,” co-hosted by her mother, Lennie, is in its 15th season).

“What’s Your Pleasure?,” an album designed for escape, gave her music career a jolt. Her fifth LP — “That! Feels Good!,” out Friday — is a sequel of sorts, but the earlier album’s synth thump is joined by a new dimension: soulful, brassy warmth, often thanks to Kokoroko, an eight-piece band. “I’ve always longed to make soul music,” Ware said. “I’ve done bits and bobs of it, but this felt very focused and authentic.”
Scrolling through a list of cultural influences on her phone in the bar of a New York hotel, Ware debated what to include. “You think Fran Lebowitz would be my friend if I put her in the Top 10?” she asked, before deciding, “She wouldn’t want to be my friend because I’m on my phone too much.” These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

Photo Booths

I’m constantly trying to make my phone take pictures that look old and romantic, and the photo booth just does that. And also the fact that you can’t change it — I like that, and that they’re these four pictures that can take you back to a nostalgic moment. My husband did a photography degree but he’s [expletive] at taking photos of me: terrible angles, manages to always take them when my eyes are half open. What I’ve just started doing is taking selfies of myself, but pretending that I’m being caught off guard so that I can get really good photos with my children.

‘The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills’

It’s dirty and naughty and I probably should be doing something else, but I’m there, invested in the Kathy and Kyle drama. And I love it. It centers me. And my husband walks in and he’s like, What are you watching? And I’m like, Don’t judge me, these are really important women that are telling very important stories and they’re very entertaining. I love Mauricio. I live for the moments when he’s stoned. Dorit has really grown on me, I think she’s got real wit. I really miss Lisa Vanderpump. I loved her.

Eggs

Because they’re versatile. Because you can have them at any meal. Because I wrote a book called “Omelet.” They solve a lot of problems. I feel at home with an egg anywhere. I said this in my book, but if there was a crisis, my mum would be like, “Do you want an omelet, darling?” So it became like this thing where like my brother was like, I don’t want a [expletive] omelet.

My Saved Places on Google Maps

I hate missing out on good food in a new place. It’s kind of slightly stressful. When we were on holiday for our honeymoon, I wasn’t a bridezilla, I was a honeymoonzilla. But I didn’t have the Google Maps saved lists that could have made my life easier. So when I’m on tour, I save places that people recommend. It’s so good for being able to work out your route for the day, like, I’m going to go to this coffee shop, then I’m going to go to the famous cemetery in Buenos Aires, and then I’m going to walk from there.

Matinees

Jamie Lee Curtis said that whole thing about like, Why doesn’t Coldplay do a matinee? I completely agree with her. Apparently Little Mix have always been doing matinees. Much respect to them. The idea of going onstage at 9 p.m. sometimes fills me with total dread, when I’m usually in my pajamas watching “Real Housewives” or something. Can you call a lunch a matinee? Anything that’s, like, in the day. Then you have time to digest it, understand it, enjoy it. But also time for that eight hours sleep.

6
Handwritten Letters

I don’t do it enough, but I appreciate them so much. And handwritten cards. Emails, I’m over it, I know that that’s how we function. Text messages, I get it. But there’s nothing more thoughtful than a handwritten letter. I think I read that Reese Witherspoon did this, but I write my children a letter every year. They’ve all got their own book, and I write them a letter, mainly so I can remember what they did in the year. Because I know that when they get to like, 21, then they’re going to ask me and I’ll be like, I don’t know what your first word was.

7
Musicals

It’s kind of where I began singing. It’s something that’s really inspired how I make music — that idea of escapism and the idea of melodrama combined with emotion. I like that fantasy aspect of it, that it can kind of elevate. If you say you hate musical theater, I’m going to question our friendship, because I don’t believe that you’ve gone to see good enough musical theater.

8
‘The Traitors’

I’m talking about the first season of the British series. If anybody played the game at university called Mafia, where you have to say who the killer is and they have to kill other people whilst you’re like, staring? The premise is that, and we would all be very rich if whilst we were getting stoned at uni, we thought that could be a great format for television.

Foreign Pharmacies

There was a time when you could get Valium in India when I was in my 20s. That was a fantastic time. But also for the products, particularly in the French pharmacies, the beauty products. I mean, you can now get Bioderma everywhere now, but there was a time where everybody would come back from Fashion Week with loads of Bioderma. I love perusing the aisles of a foreign pharmacy and getting any kind of insect repellent, sunglasses, chewing gum.

Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge, or the Knockoff

I got it for my husband for Christmas, but I wear it. It’s obscenely expensive. One day my beautician came ’round to give me a wax, and I said, “You smell really good!” She went, “Oh babe, I got it in Zara.” I was like, You’re kidding me. Zara has done a knockoff, so you don’t need to spend the bloody amount of money that I did. It smelled exactly the same.

    "12" : """ Alec Baldwin was mounted on a chestnut horse in a steep gully in a snow-dusted valley in Montana on Friday, his first day back filming “Rust,” the western whose cinematographer was shot and killed in 2021 when a gun he was practicing with on its set went off.

“Set, ready, and … action,” cried Gerard DiNardi, the movie’s new first assistant director, and Mr. Baldwin urged the horse forward, toward a camera rigged on a pickup truck.

As Mr. Baldwin returned to the set of “Rust,” prosecutors in New Mexico filed court papers formally dismissing, at least for now, the involuntary manslaughter charges he had been facing in the shooting of the film’s original cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins, who was killed outside Santa Fe, where the movie was initially filmed.

The prosecutors, Jason Lewis and Kari Morrissey, wrote in their filing in the case of the State of New Mexico vs. Alexander Rae Baldwin III that they were withdrawing the charges against him “since new facts were revealed that demand further investigation and forensic analysis” that could not be completed before a hearing, set to begin on May 3, at which a judge was to rule on whether the charges against Mr. Baldwin could proceed.

But the prosecutors held out the possibility that new charges against Mr. Baldwin could still be filed, writing that “the investigation is active and on-going.”

The prosecutors dropped the charges after receiving new evidence suggesting that the gun Mr. Baldwin had been practicing with when it fired the bullet that killed Ms. Hutchins had been modified without his knowledge, according to an official close to the investigation who was granted anonymity to discuss the case.

The new evidence cast doubt on the prosecution’s argument that Mr. Baldwin must have pulled the trigger, the official said. Mr. Baldwin, who was told the day of the shooting that the gun he was practicing with did not contain any live ammunition, has denied pulling the trigger, saying the gun fired after he had pulled its hammer back and let it go.

Seth Kenney, the owner of PDQ Arm & Prop, an Albuquerque company that was the primary supplier of guns to the production, said that he had not modified any of the guns he supplied for “Rust” and had no reason to, because all of them already functioned smoothly.

“The guns were not modified,” he said in an interview on Friday. “They were brand-new and in perfect working order.”

Mr. Baldwin, 65, has maintained that he was not responsible for the fatal shooting, which took place on Oct. 21, 2021, on a church set on a ranch outside Santa Fe. He has sued several people associated with the film, including the movie’s original first assistant director and its armorer, accusing them of negligence for giving him a loaded gun on the set that fired. The original first assistant director, Dave Halls, reached a plea deal with prosecutors and was sentenced to six months of probation.

The film’s original armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who loaded the gun that day and was responsible for weapons and ammunition on the set, still faces involuntary manslaughter charges. She had also originally faced a preliminary hearing on the charges in May, but on Friday Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer agreed to delay it until Aug. 9, in part so that prosecutors could subpoena witnesses in their investigation.

Mr. Baldwin still faces several civil suits. Gloria Allred, a lawyer representing Mamie Mitchell, the former script supervisor for “Rust,” and Ms. Hutchins’s parents and sister, said in a statement on Friday that “we remain committed to fighting and winning for our clients and holding him accountable for pointing a loaded gun at Halyna Hutchins, pulling the trigger and killing her.”

“He can run to Montana and pretend that he is just an actor in a wild west movie,” she said in the statement, “but, in real life, he cannot escape from the fact that he had a major role in a tragedy which had real-life consequences for Halyna, her mother, father, sister and co-worker.” Mr. Baldwin has denied the claims in the civil suits against him.

The revived production of “Rust” is going ahead with the support of Ms. Hutchins’s widower, Matthew Hutchins, who was named an executive producer.

After New Mexico’s Occupational Health and Safety Bureau found that the company had demonstrated “plain indifference to the recognized hazards associated with the use of firearms on set,” the company behind the movie, Rust Movie Productions, agreed this year to pay a $100,000 settlement, which included a downgraded citation.

As filmmakers returned to finish the movie more than a year after the killing of Ms. Hutchins had shut down the film, they moved the production here to Montana, to a film set just north of Yellowstone National Park. Joel Souza, who was also struck by the bullet that killed Ms. Hutchins, was back in the director’s chair. He said in a statement that his “every effort on this film will be devoted to honoring Halyna’s legacy and making her proud.”

At the new location, Mr. Baldwin had gotten back into character as Harland Rust, a notorious outlaw who helps his grandson escape the death penalty, fleeing with him on horseback.

As filming resumed, and a light snow fell on the shrub land, the film’s newly hired armorer, Andrew Wert, adjusted the leather bandolier fitted onto the actor. Placed inside was what appeared to be ammunition for a .45 Long Colt. The bullets were rubber.

    "13" : """ The creator and two stars of the new Netflix series “Beef” addressed a brewing controversy on Friday about another actor on the show who said on a podcast in 2014 that he had sexually assaulted a masseuse, comments now recirculating on social media.

David Choe, an actor and artist, has long said that he made up the incident he recounted on his podcast, an assertion that the show’s creator, Lee Sung Jin, and its lead actors, Steven Yeun and Ali Wong, backed up in a statement.

“The story David Choe fabricated nine years ago is undeniably hurtful and extremely disturbing,” said Lee, Yeun and Wong, who are also executive producers on “Beef.” “We do not condone this story in any way, and we understand why this has been so upsetting and triggering.”

They added, “We’re aware David has apologized in the past for making up this horrific story, and we’ve seen him put in the work to get the mental health support he needed over the last decade to better himself and learn from his mistakes.”

Netflix confirmed the authenticity of the statement, which was made exclusively to Vanity Fair, but declined to comment. Choe and representatives for Lee, Yeun and Wong did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

On a 2014 episode of a podcast that Choe co-hosted, he talked about engaging in what he called “rape-y behavior” when he coerced a masseuse into oral sex. He later said that the story was made up.

“I never raped anyone,” he told The New York Times two years ago.

The clip from his podcast has recirculated on social media since the premiere of “Beef” this month. The show stars Yeun and Wong as Angelenos who get into a road-rage conflict that ripples into the rest of their lives, and Choe appears in seven episodes as the cousin of Yeun’s character.

The 10-episode season has received praise from critics and was the service’s second-most-watched English-language show this week, according to Netflix.

Choe hosted a four-episode limited series on FX and Hulu in 2021 and has appeared in other shows sporadically, including in one episode of “The Mandalorian.” “Beef” is his first substantial acting role.

Choe gained broad recognition in 2012, after an initial public offering appeared to make him a multimillionaire.

Several years earlier, the entrepreneur Sean Parker had asked Choe to paint murals in the Palo Alto, Calif., offices of an internet start-up. Parker offered him $60,000 or stock in the nascent company, Choe has said, which is how Choe wound up a very early shareholder in Facebook, which is now called Meta.

    "14" : """ Valda Setterfield, a leading figure in the New York dance world for 60 years and the wife and muse of the renowned choreographer David Gordon, died on April 9 in Manhattan. She was 88.

Alyce Dissette, the producing director of the Pick Up Performance Company, which Mr. Gordon founded in 1971, said Ms. Setterfield died in her sleep in a hospital, which she had entered a week earlier with pneumonia.

In a career that took her from the Russian dancer and teacher Tamara Karsavina in the 1950s to Woody Allen in the 1990s, Ms. Setterfield was often Mr. Gordon’s onstage partner, an association that began before their marriage in 1961 and lasted until their 2018 season at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Her ties with Merce Cunningham, as a dancer in his company, a teacher of his technique and one of his trusted friends, endured for decades.

Ms. Setterfield had a singularly theatrical presence onstage, and often offstage as well, dressing imaginatively in clothes she had assembled from thrift shops. That theatricality was heightened by her impeccable diction and her low, melodious speaking voice. She and Mr. Gordon were once called “the Barrymores of postmodern dance.”

Valda Setterfield was born on Sept. 17, 1934, in Margate, England, in the county of Kent, and grew up in the Kent town of Birchington-on-Sea. She was the only child of Eileen (Walker) Setterfield, a homemaker, and Thomas Valentine Setterfield, who went from venture to venture professionally.

Her passion for dance, which she discovered when she was about 4, took her to London, where she studied with Marie Rambert and Ms. Karsavina. She watched the foremost dancers of the day at Covent Garden and other theaters, forming a particular devotion to Margot Fonteyn.

When Ms. Setterfield was in her early 20s, she met the critic and performer David Vaughan, an Englishman with an eclectic taste in dance forms who had moved to New York in 1950. He became a lifelong friend. “You know,” she later recalled him telling her, “they have very interesting ideas in New York that we don’t have.”

Following his suggestion, Ms. Setterfield tried New York, arriving with a scholarship from the choreographer José Limón. Soon she was studying with Merce Cunningham and James Waring. It was in these circles that she met David Gordon, an intellectually curious young New Yorker who was already performing for Mr. Waring.

Mr. Cunningham was not yet a celebrity. Still, just watching him teach class, Ms. Setterfield told The Guardian in 2019, she thought, “This is why I came to America!” His class, she said, “had an anatomical sense to it — it went into an amazing range of shapes and steps, as well as the most thrilling rhythmic combinations.” Mr. Cunningham, she recalled, said to her, “Don’t make everything so pretty,” an observation she found revelatory.

Mr. Waring’s work often seemed small-scale, but it opened many doors in its striking blurring of the distinctions between art and life, its cultivation of a form of theatricality sometimes labeled camp, and its study of nonvirtuoso forms of movement.

In the early 1960s, Ms. Setterfield and Mr. Gordon found themselves well aligned for the dance experimentalism that took off at the Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village. The dancers and choreographers Yvonne Rainer and Trisha Brown were among their most valued colleagues. In due course, Mr. Gordon and Ms. Setterfield moved into a loft in the same Lower Broadway building where Ms. Brown and two other choreographers, Lucinda Childs and Douglas Dunn, lived.

During these years, Ms. Setterfield often played nondance roles for visiting dance companies at the Metropolitan Opera House. Decades later, she would speak in awe of sharing the stage with Ms. Fonteyn in “The Sleeping Beauty” and the Bolshoi’s Galina Ulanova in “Romeo and Juliet.”

Mr. Cunningham engaged Ms. Setterfield briefly in 1961, the year she married Mr. Gordon. On Aug. 5 of that year, she was one of nine highly individual dancers cast in the world premiere of Mr. Cunningham’s “Aeon,” with a score by John Cage and designs by Robert Rauschenberg, neither yet the artistic celebrity he would become.

“Aeon,” which Mr. Cage described as “epic in character,” was 45 minutes long. It began with a series of small explosions, and its sequences could be performed so as to overlap. Mr. Rauschenberg, in those days the Cunningham company’s stage manager as well as its chief designer, devised a machine that crossed the stage on a rope.

At the Judson Church, Ms. Setterfield danced in works by Ms. Rainer, Mr. Gordon and others. Here, pedestrian movement was OK; improvisation was OK; minimalism was OK. And, although Ms. Rainer famously announced “No to theatricality,” it would have been truer to say that the Judson dance makers were continually re-exploring theatricality and redefining the nature of theater.

Ms. Setterfield combined these activities with motherhood. She left the Cunningham troupe when she and Mr. Gordon had a son, Ain, in 1962, but she was brought back in 1965 and stayed until 1975, creating roles in 13 Cunningham works. The sets were designed by, among others, Jasper Johns, Bruce Nauman and Frank Stella; the composers included John Cage, Toshi Ichiyanagi, Pauline Oliveros and David Tudor.

Mr. Gordon established the Pick Up Performance Company to make new dances in 1971. Three years later he created “Chair” for Ms. Setterfield and himself, which introduced a long series of works in which she was his partner, his muse or his protagonist. Those works were often about the connections and paradoxes between art and life.

In 1982, the couple were the subject of a long profile in The New Yorker written by the critic Arlene Croce. It was one of many signs that postmodern dance had graduated into the big leagues.

As the years passed, it pleased Mr. Gordon to find an ever more diverse array of roles for his wife.

In 1988, when he created “Mates” for Britain’s Rambert Dance Company, he gave her a role, thus linking her to the troupe’s founder, Marie Rambert, who had trained her more than 30 years before. Ms. Setterfield was the artist Marcel Duchamp in Mr. Gordon’s “The Mysteries and What’s So Funny” (1991), the Old Man and the Old Woman in his adaptation of Eugene Ionesco’s “The Chairs” (2004), and Bertolt Brecht in his “Uncivil Wars” (2006).

Ms. Setterfield also performed independently of Mr. Gordon, in acting as well as dancing roles. She had featured film roles in Brian De Palma’s “The Wedding Party” (1969) and Yvonne Rainer’s “Lives of Performers” (1972), and minor roles in two movies by Woody Allen, “Mighty Aphrodite” (1995) and “Everyone Says I Love You” (1996).

On television, she was seen in “Beyond the Mainstream” (1980), an episode of the PBS series “Dance in America.” In 1987, she co-starred with Mikhail Baryshnikov in “David Gordon’s Made in USA,” an installment of PBS’s “Great Performances.” And in 1992 she was a member of the White Oak Dance Project, the company founded by Mr. Baryshnikov.

From 1994 to 2013, Ms. Setterfield appeared with Paradigm, a collective led by her former Cunningham colleague Gus Solomons Jr.; in 2008, she performed in a work by a much younger Cunningham alumnus, Jonah Bokaer.

In 2009 and 2010, she performed in France and other countries, including the United States, with the French choreographer Boris Charmatz in a Cunningham-derived production. (“Would Merce be amused?” she wrote in an email at the time. “I like to think so. Into the unknown, integrity ahoy!”)

When Mr. Gordon’s “Live Archiveography” was presented at the Kitchen in Manhattan in 2017, Ms. Setterfield appeared on center stage, as she did in Mr. Gordon’s 2018 revival of his 1972 work “The Matter” at the Museum of Modern Art.

When she was in her 80s, she played the title role in “Lear,” created (after Shakespeare’s play) by the Irish choreographer John Scott, for which she won a Herald Angel Award at the 2016 Edinburgh Festival. Among her other honors were several New York Dance and Performance Awards, also known as the Bessie.

Ms. Setterfield collaborated a number of times with her son, Ain Gordon, notably in the Off Broadway play “The Family Business” (1995), which also included her husband, and for which all three won an Obie Award.

Mr. Gordon died in January 2022, the morning after he and Ms. Setterfield had celebrated their 61st wedding anniversary. She is survived by their son; his husband, the dancer and choreographer Wally Cardona (who performed with her at MoMA in “The Matter” revival); and two granddaughters.

“Rescued” is the first new song Foo Fighters have released since the sudden death of the band’s beloved drummer Taylor Hawkins in March 2022, and its lyrics seem to address that tragedy and the remaining members’ grief. “It happened so fast, and then it was over,” Dave Grohl sings before unleashing one of those signature screams that manages to be throat-lacerating and melodic: “Is this happening now?” Hawkins’s absence is a gaping void in “Rescued,” the first track from a June album, “But Here We Are.” But perhaps because of it, the Foos sound more focused than they have in a while, driven by a fresh sense of pathos and urgency.

Katie Gavin lets a missed connection know exactly what they’re missing on the bold and sassy “One That Got Away,” a new single the pop group Muna debuted last weekend at Coachella. “If you never put it on the line, how am I gonna sign for it?” Gavin sings on the synth-driven track, as the booming, echoing production serves to effectively amplify her feelings. ZOLADZ

“I know that everything is feeling like it’s falling apart all the time,” sings Lindsey Olsen, who records as Salami Rose Joe Louis, in “Dimcola Reprise” from her coming album, “Akousmatikous” (which means “sound where there is no identifiable source” in Greek). Most of the track is a busily looping, pattering, burbling electronic backdrop for her whispery voice, which eventually advises, “It’s gonna be OK/Just make it through the day.” But before it ends, the song pivots completely, turning to slow chromatic chords and suspended vocal harmonies — a brief moment of respite. JON PARELES

Aaron Jerome, the English electronic music producer who calls himself Sbtrkt and performs behind a mask, has been working over “L.F.O.” since 2018, apparently making it stranger with each iteration. It’s an ever-evolving succession of thick, harmonically ambiguous synthesizer chords, coalescing into a rhythm and pushing it aside, accelerating and falling apart and reconverging. The lyrics, delivered in Sampha’s eerie falsetto and George Riley’s confessional breathiness, offer paradoxes and self-questioning: “I’m changing, moving, losing, higher,” Riley sings. The song will be on Sbtrkt’s new album, “The Rat Road,” in May. Whatever the context, it’s likely to be destabilizing. PARELES

The Argentine singer Nathy Peluso enlisted the hitmaking producer Illangelo (the Weeknd, Post Malone) for the furious kiss-off “Tonta” (“Foolish”). A thumping, clattering beat propels her indictment of her ex from seething to sneering to a well-placed scream. She also shows some gleeful scorn as she overdubs her voice into a mocking horn section, trumpeting “tararatata” as she demolishes any hopes of reconciliation. PARELES

Bad Bunny, proudly from Puerto Rico, is determined to expand his music into a pan-Latin coalition. With “Un x100to” (“One Percent”), he joins Grupo Frontera, a Mexican-rooted norteño band from Texas, for a song about using the last 1 percent of his cellphone power to call an ex and confess that he misses her. Grupo Frontera’s section of the song is a traditional-flavored, accordion-backed cumbia. Bad Bunny arrives with a different, rap-informed melody over arena-scale electronic chords. But with Grupo Frontera working, he returns to the clip-clop beat and chorus of the cumbia — another strategic alliance certified. JON PARELES

“I thought that I was hungry for love,” Florence Welch sings at the beginning of a menacing new song, “Mermaids,” adding, “Maybe I was just hungry for blood.” The dark, brooding track sounds of a piece with “Dance Fever,” the group’s 2022 album that often found Welch threading her personal recollections and musings into a more mythical tapestry. That contrast emerges in the second movement of “Mermaids,” when Welch sings memorably about long nights of London debauchery and “hugging girls that smelt like Britney Spears and coconuts.” ZOLADZ

At Coachella and now online, Chris of Christine and the Queens has gone primal and musically skeletal. “I need you to love me,” he sings in “True Love,” over a blipping, tapping two-chord track, joined by 070 Shake, who sees “your dark eyes staring at me.” The song is measured and quantized, but thoroughly obsessional. PARELES

The latest cross-cultural foray by the banjoist Béla Fleck is a collaboration with the bassist Edgar Meyer and two Indian musicians: Zakir Hussain on tabla and Rakesh Chaurasia on bansuri (bamboo flute). For most of “Motion,” Fleck takes a supporting role behind rising, inquisitive melodies from the bass and bansuri as Hussain’s tabla stirs up a fluttering momentum. When banjo and bansuri share a melody in unison, the eerie timbre is an acoustic discovery. PARELES

    "16" : """ “Giving voice to our darkest thoughts is how we gain access to our deepest truths,” the true believer Lisa tells Adult Natalie as a prompt during one of Lottie’s workshops. Indeed, Lottie’s methodology is proven right over the course of the fifth episode of “Yellowjackets,” where destructive secrets are wantonly shared. But there is little healing to come from these confessions, only more destruction.

Take, for instance, Misty.

Teen Misty is feeling especially loose lipped thanks to her friendship with her “bestie” Crystal. Some facts we learn about Misty: The three famous people she would invite to a slumber party are Plato, the “Grind” host Eric Nies and Jack Kevorkian because what he does is “so brave.” She hates deodorant. She once walked in on her parents having sex and wasn’t all that grossed out. And, of course, the one we already know: She destroyed the plane’s emergency transmitter the night after the crash so she could remain the Yellowjackets’ hero in crisis.

That last one doesn’t sit well with Crystal, whose name, it turns out, is actually Kristen. That’s the kind of secret that she shared with Misty, explaining that she never corrected her teammates when they mistakenly called her “Crystal the pistol” on the first day of practice. It’s a detail about her life that she revels in sharing with her best friend, something sort of embarrassing but not actually all that shameful. Misty misreads Crystal’s acceptance. Rather than celebrate their shared oddity when Misty utters the story about the transmitter, Crystal’s expression drops. Misty is the reason they are all stranded. Suddenly the game isn’t fun.

Misty tries to save face, pretending she’s just kidding, but Crystal knows better. “You’re not that good of an actress,” she says. Misty, facing social isolation once more, resorts to a threat, vowing to kill Crystal if she tells anyone. She doesn’t have to. Crystal stumbles backward and plummets to her death. When Misty returns to the cabin, she tells the group Crystal got lost in the raging storm that just descended on the wilderness knowing full well Crystal’s mangled body is at the foot of a cliff.

In the present, Walter Tattersall also knows that Misty isn’t a very good actress. Their dynamic mirrors Misty and Crystal’s, though Misty isn’t as willing a participant in the banter he’s trying to start. She reluctantly plays his game of “two truths and a lie” before getting distracted upon finding the gate to Lottie’s compound. When Natalie emerges, it’s not the reunion for which Misty had hoped: Natalie sends the betrayed and frustrated Misty away.

What Misty fails to recognize is she finally has someone sitting across from her who will accept her strangeness wholeheartedly. Walter has figured out she was likely involved in Adam Martin’s death, but he doesn’t really care. “I like you regardless of your extracurricular activities,” he says.

He’s had his own odd experience with killers — his grandma murdered his grandfather, apparently — and is bizarrely charmed by Misty’s nefariousness. This isn’t the same situation as Shauna’s daughter, Callie, and the creepy cop who is trying to pry clues out of her through bowling dates. Unless I’m mistaking his earnestness for something else, Walter says what he means.

But Misty rejects that. She’s offended that he thinks she’s a murderer and fails to see that she might finally have a weirdo who matches her, a bestie who’s even more sympathetic than Crystal, may she rest in peace. Instead, she leaves Walter behind and marches up to Lottie’s community with a new plan: She’s going to join up.

In that enclave, Natalie has been trying to unearth some secrets of her own. She finally manages to dig around Lottie’s office, and discovers boxes of personal documents about Lottie’s followers. To her it looks like a gold mine, but she’s quickly shut down when it turns out everyone relinquished that information willingly.

With Natalie despondent, Lottie turns the tables on her, encouraging Natalie to divulge what she’s been hiding — specifically, what she told Travis that led to his death. Using a technique from her “time away” — a euphemistic term for when she was institutionalized — Lottie flashes a light in Natalie’s eyes and coaxes out of her the story of the last time she saw Travis.

It’s a seedy tale in which Natalie and Travis went on a bender and Natalie overdosed. In her unconscious state, Natalie saw a vision of the Yellowjackets’ crash site, but none of them had survived. The mysterious figure known as the “antler queen” moves through the vessel among the corpses. When Natalie was revived she told Travis: “I saw it. I felt it. We brought it back. Trav, we brought it back with us.”

As she shares this, Lottie, terrified, looks over her shoulder and sees the shadow of that same person or creature. “Yellowjackets” viewers have theorized that Lottie was the “antler queen” because she dons a crown made of antlers at the “Doomcoming.” But now Lottie is the one haunted by that image. Is it her own shadow self that’s scaring her? Or is the “antler queen” even a single being? Is it instead the manifestation of the “darkness” all of the Yellowjackets carry?

That darkness has arrived at Adult Van’s apartment-slash-video store in the form of Taissa. Tai is aware she is placing a huge burden on Van by asking for her help. Meanwhile, Van has some hidden habits of her own, squirreling away oxycodone when she thinks Tai is asleep. And Tai is asleep when Van takes the drug. It’s the “other one” — Tai’s alter ego — who emerges in the darkness and kisses Van. “This isn’t where we are supposed to be,” she says.

It’s easy to think of the spirits plaguing these women and girls as evil, yet in the final moments of the hour we’re given an example of wilderness mysticism as a force for good. Pregnant Shauna has grown understandably suspicious of Lottie, who whispers to her baby in utero. But when Shauna and Tai are stranded in heavy snowfall they are seemingly guided by Lottie’s mantras about hearing the wind and the trees. They are able to make it back as Shauna goes into labor, her primal scream of pain ending the episode.

In an earlier scene, Lottie had told the fetus, “You are going to change everything.” Now the child is here, a new life entering the world replacing Crystal, who has left it. Bye, bestie. Hello, baby.

More to chew on

Adult Shauna’s Built to Spill T-shirt is a great costuming choice.

An interesting fact for those keeping track of where everyone was post-rescue: Tai and Van were still together when Shauna got married. They swapped out the guest book pen for a dirty novelty pen.

I think the creepiest character on the show might be Matt Saracusa, the adult detective who pretends to date a teen to solve a case. In addition to its general ickiness, I grew tired of that whole plotline this episode including Shauna’s fake tryst with Randy, the most useless character on the show.

The motif of videotape static has been with the show since the beginning thanks to the opening credits, but it’s being deployed more and more in the narrative. What does it mean?

Is Misty actually a murderer? Technically, she isn’t as far as we know, and maybe that’s why she’s so angry at Walter’s assumption. She’s definitely an accessory and you could probably charge her with manslaughter. But straight up murder? Not yet.

Does Crystal become the next meal?

    "17" : """ The first thing we learn about Amanda (Rachael Leigh Cook) in “A Tourist’s Guide to Love” is that she works for a high-end agency called Tourista World Travel. But nobody in this Netflix film even comments on the fact that “turista” is slang for vacation-wrecking diarrhea. That puzzling choice and its utter lack of consequences are the only surprise in Steven Tsuchida’s film, a rom-com that so scrupulously fulfills every cliché of the genre, it might as well have been devised by ChatGPT.

Amanda is dispatched to Vietnam to check out a small tour company that Tourista is considering buying to develop its market in the area. The assignment is also a good distraction: She was recently dumped by her dull accountant boyfriend, John (Ben Feldman). Going undercover as a regular tourist, albeit an extremely well-prepared one, she’s immediately drawn to the floppy-haired guide, Sinh (Scott Ly). He is the kind of dreamboat who has both abs and sensitivity, and can show Amanda not just his country’s beauty, but how to enjoy life.

Sinh eventually doffs his shirt at the beach and emerges from the water in resplendent slow motion, because the clichés here are as tightly packed in as tchotchkes in a traveler’s suitcase: Amanda is a perky American Type A; village elders are cute as buttons and wise as Yoda; street food is tantalizing; jaded Westerners rediscover themselves as they ditch their phones and bask in a rural experience made only sweeter by the knowledge that it’s temporary. The soundtrack’s catchy Vietnamese songs provide the only fizz in this otherwise flat concoction.

    "18" : """ “Ghosted,” a frothy spy-thriller rom-com in the tradition of “Romancing the Stone” and “The Jewel of the Nile,” is one of the least convincing movies I have ever seen. I don’t just mean that the dialogue is trite and phony, or that the characters feel inauthentic, or that the action is badly choreographed, or even that the plot is paper-thin and contrived, although all of this is regrettably true.

I mean that “Ghosted” barely seems like a real movie. It has movie stars, in the figures of Ana de Armas and Chris Evans (and, as the villain, Adrien Brody). It has a competent director, Dexter Fletcher, whose hit “Rocketman” wasn’t half-bad.

But this tedious, unfunny, screamingly unoriginal romantic adventure film is so flimsy and so insubstantial that it’s practically vaporous.

Evans, who can be charming, stars as Cole, a clean-cut, down-to-earth farmer who dreams of publishing a book on the history of agriculture. While working at his family market stall one afternoon, he meets Sadie (de Armas), and within minutes the two embark on a high-speed fling. But it turns out that Sadie is a C.I.A. agent, code name the Taxman, and in a gender-reversed “True Lies” situation, Cole is swiftly embroiled in Sadie’s high-stakes world of international espionage, whisked off in escapades across London and far-flung destinations that look like they were filmed on green screens.

Evans and de Armas are likable actors, but any charm they might have mustered for each other is torpedoed by the facile writing, featuring such memorable zingers as “I have dated some crazies in my day, but you are certifiable!”

The spy stuff is also laughable. The movie seems more concerned with shoehorning in transparently fan-baiting cameos (including Sebastian Stan and Ryan Reynolds) than with developing anything remotely like credible stakes, while the action set pieces suffer from unimaginative staging and some of the cheapest-looking visual effects in recent memory.

    "19" : """ Jessica Burstein, a photographer who in extended assignments captured three quintessentially New York institutions — the “Law & Order” television franchise, the new Yankee Stadium as it was being built and the restaurant and celebrity hangout Elaine’s — died on April 11 at her home in Manhattan. She was 76.

The cause was lung cancer, her sister Patricia Burstein said.

In 1992, Ms. Burstein became the official photographer at Elaine’s, the night spot on the Upper East Side of Manhattan where writers, athletes, actors, politicians and filmmakers gathered in a salon overseen by the imperious owner, Elaine Kaufman.

Ms. Burstein came as she pleased, with her only tangible reward the display of her framed pictures on a restaurant wall (Ms. Kaufman did not pay her). Over the next 19 years, until it closed, she photographed scenes from the haunt: Ms. Kaufman counting cash; Joan Rivers resting her head on Ms. Kaufman’s shoulder; a tired-looking Andy Rooney, the CBS commentator, with a drink in hand; a party to celebrate the 100th episode of “Law & Order”; and Christo, the epic-scale fabric artist, in a romantic moment with his wife and collaborator, Jeanne-Claude. She also crafted striking tableside portraits of luminaries like Liza Minnelli and William Styron.

In 2002, Ms. Burstein shot a wild bit of revelry featuring Candace Bushnell, the author of the book “Sex and the City” (1996), which inspired the long-running HBO series of the same title. Ms. Bushnell had her right leg extended and her left leg bent, while one man kissed her ankle and another man held her. In the background, the writer Gay Talese, a longtime Elaine’s patron, was in deep conversation with a woman.

“Candace was a few sheets to the wind,” Ms. Burstein told the journalism blogger Jim Fitzpatrick in 2010. “She would admit that.” Ms. Bushnell had made eye contact with Ms. Burstein, apparently hoping that she would photograph the scene.

In a phone interview, Mr. Talese described the relationship between Ms. Burstein and Ms. Kaufman.

“I think what was significant about Jessica, in addition to her good photography, she was one of the few women that Elaine welcomed and liked,” he said. “She was very engaging, and she wasn’t threatening.”

Ms. Burstein met Dick Wolf, the creator of the “Law & Order” franchise, at Elaine’s in 1993. He soon hired her to photograph the crime scenes that were conceived weekly for the original “Law & Order” series.

She became the show’s photographer in 1994 and stayed until 2010, when it was canceled. (It was revived last year.) She was also the photographer for the spinoffs “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,” until 2007, and “Law & Order: Criminal Intent,” through 2011.

In an email, Mr. Wolf praised Ms. Burstein for “her ability to capture real human emotion in the artificiality of a film set.”

Ms. Burstein and Mr. Wolf collaborated on a 2003 book, “Law & Order: Crime Scenes,” which led to an exhibition of the same name at the George Eastman House in Rochester, N.Y., in 2005.

Jennifer Curtis, who helped design the exhibition, said in a phone interview that Ms. Burstein’s “crime scene photos were similar to Weegee’s,” referring to the celebrated New York City tabloid photographer of the 1930s and ’40s.

Jessica May Burstein was born on April 7, 1947, in Mineola, N.Y., on Long Island, and grew up in nearby Lawrence. Her mother, Beatrice (Sobel) Burstein, was one of the first women to serve as a justice of the New York State Supreme Court. Her father, Herbert, was an international lawyer.

After surgery when she was 8 to correct a condition that caused her right eye to wander, Jessica received a Brownie camera as a therapeutic device. Not long after, she set up a darkroom and began to use a Nikon.

She graduated from New York University with a bachelor’s degree in 1968, then worked for six years as an assistant to the prominent commercial photographer Bert Stern. In 1974, she was hired as a staff photographer at NBC; she is believed to have been the first woman in that job.

“At that time, the reality is, they needed to hire what they considered to be a minority, someone of color or a woman,” she told the newspaper Our Town in 2015.

Ms. Burstein photographed news events and the set of “Saturday Night Live,” and she documented the making of the 1978 mini-series “King,” about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Bud Rukeyser, a former corporate spokesman for NBC, recalled in an email, “She was a star as an NBC photographer and was clearly on her way to a bigger and better career.”

But she told Newsday in 1978 that she had been fired after being pulled off an assignment to photograph Frank Sinatra for a network interview show because Sinatra’s wife didn’t want attractive women near him. Mr. Rukeyser said at the time that she had been laid off with 300 other employees; in his email, he said that he did not recall the Sinatra story.

She freelanced over the years for newspapers like The New York Times and The Washington Post and magazines like TV Guide, Rolling Stone, People, Time and Vanity Fair.

In 2006, she signed on as the exclusive photographer of the construction of the new Yankee Stadium, which would open in April 2009. “There was no competition for the job; we knew Jessie from some work she had already done for us,” Randy Levine, the Yankees’ president, said in a phone interview. “She was a world-class photographer.”

Her photos were used in a commemorative book for holders of Yankee premium season tickets and were exhibited at the stadium.

Ms. Curtis, who continued to work on projects with Ms. Burstein through an exhibition of her photos at the Venice Biennale last year, compared her Yankee Stadium photography to the project Margaret Bourke-White undertook in 1930 to depict the construction of the Chrysler Building.

“Like Bourke-White,” Ms. Curtis said, “Jessica scaled the structure with the support of the men and women who built the stadium to get ‘the shot.’”

Ms. Burstein donated her photo collection to the New-York Historical Society in 2017.

In addition to her sister Patricia, she is survived by another sister, Karen Burstein, a former New York State senator, and two brothers, Judd and John. Jessica and Patricia Burstein worked together on “The Grandmother Book: A Celebration of Family” (2000).

A longtime customer of Elaine’s, Ms. Burstein began her tenure as the restaurant’s photographer when she confided in Ms. Kaufman that her business was slow and that she was thinking of giving it up for law school.

“‘Are you nuts?’ she yelled at me,” Ms. Burstein wrote in an essay in “Elaine’s: The Rise of One of New York’s Most Legendary Restaurants From Those Who Were There” (2015), by Amy Phillips Penn. “‘Quit? Kid, you’re better than Avedon.’”

Ms. Kaufman added, she recalled, “You got no place to shoot, then come here to do it.”

But, Ms. Burstein noted, “Between the cost of film, processing, paper and printing, shooting at Elaine’s was to be the most expensive job I ever had.”

    "20" : """ New Mexico prosecutors are dropping the involuntary manslaughter charges that were filed against Alec Baldwin for the 2021 shooting death of a cinematographer on the set of the film “Rust,” the government’s latest setback as it pursued a high-profile case that has been closely watched by the movie industry and the country.

It was a dramatic reversal in the case against Mr. Baldwin, just months after the prosecutors who originally handled the case had filed charges against him, including one that carried five years in prison. Since then they downgraded that charge, which stemmed from a law that was not in effect at the time of the shooting; the special prosecutor leading the case stepped down after her appointment was challenged on legal grounds; and the district attorney in charge of the case, Mary Carmack-Altwies, stepped back and appointed two new special prosecutors to lead it.

The decision to drop the charges against Mr. Baldwin came after the new prosecutors reviewed new evidence that showed that the gun he was practicing with had been modified before it was delivered to the set, according to an official close to the investigation who was granted anonymity to discuss the case. That undercut the prosecution’s original argument that the gun could not have fired unless Mr. Baldwin had pulled the trigger, the official said.

It is possible that prosecutors could decide to file new charges against Mr. Baldwin.

“New facts were revealed that demand further investigation and forensic analysis in the case against Alec Baldwin,” Kari Morrissey, one of the new special prosecutors, said in a statement. “Therefore, we cannot proceed under the current time constraints and on the facts and evidence turned over by law enforcement in its existing form. This decision does not absolve Mr. Baldwin of criminal culpability and charges may be refiled.”

The shooting occurred on Oct. 21, 2021, when a gun Mr. Baldwin was practicing with on the set of “Rust” went off, killing the film’s cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins, and wounding its director, Joel Souza.

Mr. Baldwin had been told that day that the gun he was practicing with — a replica of a vintage revolver — was “cold,” meaning there was no live ammunition in it. He has maintained from the beginning that he did not pull the trigger before the gun fired, telling investigators that it went off after he had pulled the hammer back and let it go. But the original prosecutors had said that an F.B.I. analysis of the gun showed that he must have pulled the trigger, which contributed to their decision to bring charges.

In a statement, Mr. Baldwin’s lawyers, Luke Nikas and Alex Spiro, said, “We are pleased with the decision to dismiss the case against Alec Baldwin and we encourage a proper investigation into the facts and circumstances of this tragic accident.”

Paperwork officially dismissing those charges is expected to be filed before a status hearing on the case on Friday afternoon.

Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the film’s armorer, who loaded the gun the day of the shooting and was responsible for weapons on the set of the western, was also charged with involuntary manslaughter in the case. One of her lawyers, Jason Bowles, said that the charges against Ms. Gutierrez-Reed remained.

Filming on the movie is set to resume this week in Montana, where the production has moved from New Mexico. The revived production has Ms. Hutchins’s widower, Matthew Hutchins, as an executive producer.

After the news of the decision on Thursday, Mr. Baldwin posted a photo of himself and his wife on Instagram, writing, “I owe everything I have to this woman.” He added, “(and to you, Luke),” apparently referring to one of his lawyers, Mr. Nikas.

While Mr. Baldwin maintained that he never pulled the trigger, the district attorney, Ms. Carmack-Altwies, a Democrat who was elected in 2020, said when announcing the charges that an F.B.I. analysis of the gun had shown “conclusively” that the trigger had been pulled. But a person with knowledge of the investigation said that Mr. Baldwin’s legal team had recently provided prosecutors with new evidence that the gun had been modified without his knowledge in a way that made it less safe to handle.

The decision to dismiss the charges was the latest in a series of setbacks for the prosecution. After the charges against Mr. Baldwin were downgraded, Andrea Reeb, the special prosecutor originally appointed to handle the case, stepped down after his lawyers argued that her appointment violated a provision in the State Constitution that bars officials from serving in two branches of government, since she is also a state lawmaker.

A judge then ruled that Ms. Carmack-Altwies could not appoint any special prosecutor without recusing herself from the case. So she stepped down from the case last month, appointing Ms. Morrissey and Jason Lewis, New Mexico lawyers, as special prosecutors.

Investigators were not able to determine how live ammunition got onto the “Rust” set. Mr. Baldwin has said that he was following direction as he practiced drawing the gun that day.

“Someone put a live bullet in a gun, a bullet that wasn’t even supposed to be on the property,” Mr. Baldwin said in a television interview on ABC less than two months after the shooting. “Someone is ​responsible for what happened, and I can’t say who that is, but I know it’s not me.”

When her office announced that it was bringing manslaughter charges against Mr. Baldwin in January, Ms. Carmack-Altwies said that he had “an absolute duty to know that what is in the gun that is being placed in his hand is safe” — an assertion that was questioned by some actors, armorers, union leaders and others in the film industry.

SAG-AFTRA, the union representing film, television and radio workers, said in a statement at the time that her “contention that an actor has a duty to ensure the functional and mechanical operation of a firearm on a production set is wrong and uninformed” and added that “an actor’s job is not to be a firearms or weapons expert.”

The movie’s first assistant director, Dave Halls, who had oversight of safety on the “Rust” set, reached a plea deal with Ms. Carmack-Altwies and Ms. Reeb on a charge of negligent use of a deadly weapon. He was sentenced to six months of probation.

A judge in New Mexico will decide next month whether the manslaughter charges against Ms. Gutierrez-Reed should move forward. Her lawyer has said she intends to plead not guilty.

‘Planet Earth III’

When to watch: Saturday at 8 p.m., on BBC America or AMC+.

When “Planet Earth” premiered in the United States in 2007, it was a huge deal — I still remember walking home one night and noticing every TV that glowed through a window seemed to be tuned to the same ocean episode. Since then, sumptuous, epic nature documentaries have proliferated, and televised opportunities to be hypnotized by the majesty of nature abound. Now the third installment is here, as gorgeous and immersive as ever, and reaffirming the franchise’s spot at the top of the genre. Things kick off with “Coasts” — “coasts are on the front line,” David Attenborough says — and segments include seals collectively ganging up on a shark, a turtle resting its head on a rock and drooling in exhaustion and a vulnerable flock of flamingos.

… an hour and I want stand-up.

‘Zainab Johnson: Hijabs Off’

When to watch: Now, on Amazon.

This new stand-up special from the comedian Zainab Johnson covers the difficulties of dating, the role of candy in child abduction, how Harlem has changed and the perils of keeping a journal in a household with 13 children. She has a patient rhythm that belies the tightness of each segment and adds levity to some dark topics. This is also one of the more aesthetically ambitious specials in recent memory; Johnson performs in the round, and the lushness of the visual language creates a sense of a festive grandeur.

William Spetz created and stars in this Swedish dramedy (in Swedish, with subtitles, or dubbed) about Tore, a 27-year-old with a failure to launch, though he says he’s perfectly happy living at home and working at his father’s mortuary. But in the first episode, his beloved father dies, and now he has to launch wether he wants to or not. Tore bounces between wild denial (working extra hard, avoiding caring for his father’s dog) and broad attempts to spread his wings (befriending a drag queen, cultivating a crush on a cute florist). If you like distinctive delayed-coming-of-age stories, watch this.

    "22" : """ “Twilight” adapts a 1958 Friedrich Dürrenmatt detective story. It’s the tale of a retired police chief who returns to his work to find a child murderer. In György Fehér’s adaptation — released internationally in 1990, but now showing in the United States for the first time — the unnamed detective’s investigation begins when a young girl is discovered dead near a statue of an eagle holding a sword. This statue is of a Turul, a long-observed symbol of Hungarian national strength. Much like this arresting image, “Twilight” imposes a uniquely Hungarian perspective on what might have otherwise been simple pulp material.

Fehér’s adaptation sets the story squarely in the Hungarian countryside. It is light on specific details like the year of its events or the names and histories of its principal figures. The emphasis on atmosphere over evidence grants the film a fable-like quality. Even the main suspect is known only to the detective (Péter Haumann) as a giant. Fehér builds up his nightmare using visual techniques that are redolent of his countryman and sometime collaborator, the Hungarian filmmaker Béla Tarr, who is best known for his formally and philosophically challenging epics. (Fehér produced Tarr’s “Sátántangó,” and Tarr is credited as a consultant on this film.)

Tarr’s brutalist influence is visible onscreen, present in the film’s stark black-and-white cinematography, its long takes and Fehér’s elaborate, painterly camera setups. The images create the impression of a bleak landscape, a Hungary where the past, present and future appear drained not only of color, but of hope itself. Fehér’s actors offer muted, naturalistic performances, and Fehér limits the number of camera setups and cuts down on extraneous dialogue. His abundant restrictions make simple elements like cuts to close-ups or the detective plot play as cracking indulgences. It’s a style so minimalist, it approaches maximalism — and this combination of pulp and precision creates an arresting and unique work of film noir.

    "23" : """ In Hollywood these days, radical chic is back in fashion. A number of sexy thrillers that dramatize the history of radical politics or pose provocative hypotheticals about the future of activism have emerged. For my money, none match the incendiary power of “Dry Ground Burning,” a feminist gangster movie from Brazil that spits oil in the face of that country’s political establishment.

Directed by Joana Pimenta and Adirley Queirós, “Dry Ground Burning” is a film about insurrection set in the central Brazilian region of Sol Nascente. Chitara (Joana Darc Furtado) is the leader of an all-female crew that steals oil from underground pipelines, and as the kingpin, she strikes deals with gasoline vendors who sell the product at a discounted price. Chitara’s half sister, Léa (Léa Alves da Silva), an androgynous charmer with a mane of black hair, joins the posse after an eight-year stint in prison, and her arrival inspires several nostalgic conversations that temper the action with hangout-movie vibes. The two siblings nonchalantly discuss their playboy father and Léa’s 12-year-old son, conceived with an ex-con who was murdered.

Meanwhile, their compatriot, Andreia (Andreia Vieira), launches a campaign against the pro-cop candidate running for office. Hers is the Prison People Party, which represents those with criminal records, the working class, and Indigenous and Black people — in other words, those who fared the worst under the policies of Jair Bolsonaro’s far-right government, which was in power when the film was in production.

Because most people aren’t familiar with the films of Pimenta and Queirós, I’m compelled to draw a connection between “Dry Ground Burning” and “Mad Max: Fury Road,” two pyromaniacal dystopian westerns in which lawless women are not only their own saviors but everyone else’s, too.

But if “Fury Road” is a perpetual joyride, “Dry Ground” erupts between smoke breaks, switching between moments of rugged quietude and bracing scenes distinguished by invigorating, industrial sound design and the collective exultation of bodies — like the one with a motorcade carrying the rowdy members of an anarchic political party hollering a profanity-laced campaign jingle. Sodium-lit nightscapes filled with steely, gun-toting dames recall the glossy crime dramas of Michael Mann (“Heat”).

Yet “Dry Ground Burning” isn’t divorced from reality. Though Pimenta and Queirós sprinkle science-fiction touches throughout the film, their approach is steeped in renegade documentary methods and influenced by the contributions of real locals. The cast is composed of nonprofessional actors from the region who play semi-fictionalized versions of themselves — Silva, for instance, joined the production when she was released from prison. In order to clear the streets for the motorcade scene, the People Prison Party was officially registered as a political campaign.

Pimenta and Queirós invent a world in which Brazilian women at the very bottom of the social totem pole take matters into their own hands. They do so without an ounce of fear or self-pity — and in killer style to boot. And it’s not just artist types and famous actors who enact these possibilities, but the very people most empowered by imagining themselves otherwise.

    "24" : """ Loren Cameron was in his early 30s when he went to buy his first suit, walking nervously into unfamiliar territory, a haberdashery for short men. Size was a delicate subject for him. He was 5-foot-3 and wanted so much to be bigger, equating masculinity with heft — which is why he was also a dedicated body builder.

The salesman sized him up “as a regular working-class Joe,” as Mr. Cameron put it, and set out to teach him the rituals of fine dressing. He fitted Mr. Cameron into a double-breasted Italian-made suit, taught him the difference between a half and a full Windsor tie knot, and showed him four variations on folding a pocket square.

He even offered dating advice: Never give a woman a rose on a first date. Offer carnations instead.

Mr. Cameron took a self-portrait in that snappy suit, handsome, bearded and brandishing a bunch of carnations, creating one of many tender and lovely photographs of transgender men like himself that he collected in “Body Alchemy: Transsexual Portraits,” published in 1996.

“I felt at least two inches taller when I walked out of there,” Mr. Cameron wrote of his suit-shopping adventure, “and it wasn’t because of the elevator shoes.”

Mr. Cameron, a photographer and activist whose depictions of transgender people — and documentation of his own experience — inspired a generation, died on Nov. 18 at his home in Berkeley, Calif. He was 63.

The cause was suicide, his sister Susan Tarleton said, adding that he had suffered from congestive heart failure. He had been isolated from friends and family for many years, and his death was not widely reported at the time.

When “Body Alchemy” appeared, it was a revelation. At the time, it was groundbreaking, even radical, to photograph transgender people as regular folk, rather than as exotics or freaks or medical specimens, and rarer still for the lensman to be transgender.

Images of transgender women were more familiar than those of transgender men, and they were often famous figures, like Christine Jorgensen, the American actress whose transition surgery in the 1950s was front-page news, and Jan Morris, the British journalist and travel writer who wrote of her own transition in her 1974 memoir, “Conundrum.”

Over the decades, fine artists like Andy Warhol, Robert Mapplethorpe and Diane Arbus “have all trained their lenses on the transgendered figure,” Kate Bornstein, the gender theorist and author, wrote in The Bay Area Reporter in reviewing “Body Alchemy” upon its release. “Never have the transgendered seriously photographed their own. Not until Loren Cameron, that is.”

In “Body Alchemy,” for perhaps the first time, transgender men could see representations of themselves outside of the pages of medical texts.

There was Jeffrey, a Jewish man who had yearned to be a bar mitzvah, affirming his heritage, and was able to do so. Mr. Cameron photographed him in a prayer shawl and yarmulke.

Brynn, a rangy surfer, was shown in the back of his van pulling on his wet suit, short board at the ready. Stephan, a police sergeant who was honored for his valor and who transitioned while on the job, was framed against his squad car.

There were nudes, too, the most potent of which was a photo of Mr. Cameron in a classic bodybuilder pose, back arched, muscles rippling, his body emblazoned with flame-shaped tattoos, injecting his buttock with a syringe of testosterone.

Mr. Cameron wrote eloquently and honestly of the challenges of therapies, like his biweekly testosterone shot, which played havoc with his mood, escalating his temper and often making him emotionally distant from his partner, Kayt, a lesbian.

He framed a pair of portraits of himself with the typical responses his body often provoked, rendered in a bold typeface: “You’re so exotic! May I take your photograph?” “You must be some kind of freak.” “You don’t belong here.”

Despite such bigotry and stigma, Mr. Cameron’s observations reflected “a kind of innocence and awe of the body,” Patricia Holt wrote in her review for The San Francisco Examiner in 1997. She called the book a “poignant yet matter-of-fact study” of transgender people that was both “sensitive and insightful.”

Susan Stryker, the transgender historian, connected Mr. Cameron’s “breakthrough,” as she put it in a phone interview, to the AIDS crisis, when shifting notions of queer identity and community “allowed trans people previously marginalized within feminist and gay activism” to find greater visibility. “Loren was on the ground as that change was happening, and he documented it from the inside,” she said.

Mr. Cameron’s work was exhibited all over the country, in galleries and universities like Cornell, to which he donated his papers in the early 2000s, when he was in his early 40s. Among his papers is his high school yearbook showing a young woman as class president. “I was cute, huh?” Mr. Cameron wrote in the margin before he sent it to Cornell.

“He wasn’t invested in hiding that he had been a woman,” said Brenda Marston, curator of Cornell’s Human Sexuality Collection. “He put his whole body and soul out there.”

Loren Rex Cameron was born on March 13, 1959, in Pasadena, Calif. His mother, Barbara (Chambers) Cameron, was an office manager at Sears. After her death in 1968, he moved to Dover, Ark., to live with his father, Robert, a nuclear engineer and nuclear plant manager.

Robert Cameron had a farm and raised horses, and Loren worked alongside him, building fences and taking care of the horses. He was daring and adventurous as a teenager, as he wrote in “Body Alchemy,” drag racing and rafting swollen rivers. He dressed in overalls and work boots and learned to swear like a trucker.

He was deeply uncomfortable in his female body, and at age 12 he wrote away for information on sex changes. When a friend suggested that he might be a lesbian, he thought, “Why not?” But classmates began to treat him as an outcast, and he quit school and ran away from home, traveling the country by bus. He found work picking fruit and cleaning construction sites.

He ran a truck-stop fuel station and joined a youth conservation-corps crew, where he met a group of lesbians, who told him that he might find a like-minded community in San Francisco.

He lived as a lesbian for nine years before addressing his discomfort with his gender. He was 26 and had recently quit smoking pot and cigarettes. “For the first time in my life, I wasn’t numb,” he wrote.

As he began to transition, he took snapshots of the process, sending them to family and friends so they could get used to his new body and also see how happy he was. “What was initially a crude documentation of my personal journey became an impassioned mission,” he wrote. He took a basic photography class, bought a simple Pentax K1000 and began photographing other transgender people and learning their stories.

“I wanted the world to see us,” he wrote, “I mean, really see us.”

In addition to his sister Ms. Tarleton, Mr. Cameron is survived by two other sisters, Catanya Saltzman and Cameron Oppenheim, and a stepsister, Lynne Kelly.

Mr. Cameron often said his aesthetic was influenced by the photography books his parents had at home, work by Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange that made vivid the stories his father had told of growing up poor during the Depression. His work ethic was inspired by his father, who taught him to mend fences and bale hay — to honor manual labor.

“The last time I saw him, he told me that I had a lot of guts to move to California with only a duffel bag and a hundred bucks in my pocket,” Mr. Cameron wrote. “I think if he could see me now, he would be proud to call me his son.”

    "25" : """ Ten years ago, Dance Theater of Harlem was reborn. Founded in 1969, the company had gone into hiatus in 2004, saddled with debt; in 2013, it returned to the stage — full of hope and promise but shaky. Its first New York program opened with “Agon,” a difficult and exposing ballet by George Balanchine, the company’s artistic godfather, and what the performance exposed was that there was a lot of work to do.

What a difference on Wednesday, when the troupe opened its program at New York City Center with another challenging piece by Balanchine, “Allegro Brillante.” All was radiance, sparkle and joy flowing from sure technique. And all this was a testament to how well Virginia Johnson, the former company star who returned as artistic director, has led the troupe back to health. She’s now stepping down, and she can be assured she has done her job.

The lead dancers in “Allegro Brillante,” Amanda Smith and Kouadio Davis, were wonderful. Davis is solid, dependable. Smith is luxuriant. She basks in the music, milks the steps, and if she struggles a little in the middle of a quick sequence, she knows how to sell the capping pose. But the revived company has long featured a few standouts. More significant was the strength and spirit of the four backing couples: no weak links.

That’s a happy sight, a triumphant achievement, even though another erratic aspect of Johnson’s tenure — the quality of commissioned works — stayed erratic in the program’s two New York premieres.

“Sounds of Hazel” is a worthy and well-meaning project. It is a tribute to Hazel Scott, a virtuosic pianist from Harlem who was a glamorous star (appearing in movies as herself, starring in her own TV show) and also a civil rights role model (both on her own and as the wife of the congressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr.) before her career was destroyed in the Red Scare of the 1950s. We learn about her remarkable, underappreciated life in an effective introductory video and program essay. But the ballet itself is a disappointment.

Oddly, it doesn’t feature much music by Scott. We hear her version of Chopin’s “Minute Waltz,” giving us a taste of the swinging-the-classics style for which she was known, and a later track of straight-ahead Ellingtonian jazz. But mostly we hear an original score by the D.J. and composer Erica Blunt that largely sounds like hotel lounge music from the early 2000s — samples of muted trumpet with beats.

Worse, the choreography, by Tiffany Rea-Fisher, doesn’t illuminate its biographical subject. In the introductory video, Rea-Fisher tells us that the polyrhythms of Trinidad, Scott’s birthplace, allowed her to swing the classics so well, yet the dance fails to bring that idea to life. Paris, where she later lived in exile, is bizarrely represented by a kind of mannequin dance set to a music-box version of “La Vie en Rose.”

We do hear Scott’s voice, giving an amazingly calibrated, Obama-like radio speech about her love of America, despite its flaws. But what’s missing most of all is an equivalent for Scott’s virtuosity. Daphne Lee, as a Scott figure in a sparkly gown, captures her panache from the waist up, winking and miming piano playing, a bit absurdly. But Rea-Fisher doesn’t give Lee any steps that rival Scott’s thrilling runs, lighting left-hand patterns or cross-hand tricks. The showy articulateness of ballet would seem to be the perfect embodiment of Scott’s style, but here it is merely gestured at. The essential flaw of the work is too much telling, not enough showing.

It’s not as though the company’s dancers lack the technique to do Scott justice. They demonstrate it in delicious abundance in the other premiere, William Forsythe’s “Blake Works IV.” As the title indicates, this is part of a series, made for other dancers and companies, set to the moody, electronic soul music of James Blake. For a digital version created at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, it acquired a focus on the ballet barre, playfully exaggerating the side-to-side logic of barre exercises.

This iteration closely resembles previous ones, but it is this company’s first work by Forsythe, and its sexiness suits them. The solo-after-solo structure is here strung out to include 15 dancers, but that formal sameness is forgivable as, one after another, they spin and shine in individualized ways.

These dancers can do Forsythe, and they can do Balanchine. They don’t have to tell you that Dance Theater of Harlem is once again a great ballet company. They show it.

    "26" : """ He turned Will Smith into a cerulean genie for the 2019 live-action “Aladdin” and twice reimagined Sherlock Holmes as a swashbuckling rogue, to hefty box-office returns. As a filmmaker, though, Guy Ritchie has long been synonymous with sprawling ensemble pictures like “Snatch,” “The Gentlemen” and “Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels”: laddish, kinetic crime capers larded with movie stars, bloodied knuckles and inscrutable Cockney accents. (The latest of such outings, an antic international spy lark called “Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre” featuring Jason Statham, Hugh Grant and Aubrey Plaza, arrived to middling fanfare this past March.)

So why is “Guy Ritchie’s The Covenant,” a somber-looking Afghanistan war drama about an American sergeant (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his Afghan interpreter (Dar Salim), the first of the director’s 15 features to formally bear his name? The answer, according to its U.S. distributor, MGM, turns out to be fairly prosaic: Another company had already asserted rights to the title. (“Lee Daniels’ The Butler,” produced by the Weinstein Company, faced a similar challenge in court from Warner Brothers in 2013 and lost, precipitating a hasty last-minute change.)

But this kind of déjà vu is hardly new: Broad-strokes monikers like “Crash,” “Heat" and “Rush” have all done double duty over the last few decades; “Twilight” is the name of both a poorly received 1998 neo-noir starring Paul Newman and Susan Sarandon and the 2008 teen-vampire juggernaut that launched four fanged, lugubrious sequels, as well as a cult 1990 mystery by the Hungarian filmmaker György Fehér. (Ritchie might have called his latest‌ ‌ “The Interpreter” instead, had that appellation not already been claimed by a 2005 Sydney Pollack political thriller starring Nicole Kidman; so back, alas, to the drawing board.)

If the back story of “The Covenant” wanders into the weeds of copyright law, “Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio,” which won the Academy Award for best animated feature last month, makes an easier case for its qualifier: Without it, the movie could hardly be set apart from both the 1940 Disney classic still widely seen as definitive and an uncanny remake led by Tom Hanks — it currently sits at a grim 29 percent approval rating on the critical-aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes — released less than two months before.

In a larger sense, though, the inclusion of del Toro’s name also serves as shorthand and a promise, portending not only the age-old tale of a wooden boy made real but the particular vision of its maker — a lush, prolific fantasist famed for the distinctive visual style and dazzling gothic grotesqueries of films like “Pan’s Labyrinth” (2006) and the best picture-winning “The Shape of Water” (2017). That del Toro actually split directing duties for “his” “Pinocchio” with Mark Gustafson seems almost a footnote. Though Gustafson, an industry journeyman with a wide range of writing and animation credits (“Fantastic Mr. Fox," the original California Raisins), shared both the stage and the statuette with del Toro at this year’s Oscars ceremony, it’s the latter’s renown, by most Hollywood metrics, that matters.

With “Pinocchio” and the 2022 Netflix horror-anthology series “Guillermo del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities,” the director joins a long line of auteurs, from Alfred Hitchcock to Tim Burton, whose presence not merely above the title but in it serves as a stylistic marker, even when it’s not strictly their hand guiding the material. (The horror godhead Wes Craven habitually did the same; see “Wes Craven’s New Nightmare.”) Few, though, can claim to be the one-man industry that is Tyler Perry, who retains full ownership of the projects produced under his personal shingle at his stand-alone studio in Atlanta. The multihyphenate creator has famously put‌‌ his signature on several movie and television titles released under its umbrella — including “Tyler Perry’s A Madea Homecoming,” the most recent iteration of the reliably raucous comedies that he also writes and stars in as a salty, well-cushioned matriarch of a certain age.

While Madea is Perry’s wholesale creation, indubitably linked to the man who wears her wig onscreen, certain intellectual properties with roots that reach back centuries have tilted their brims instead toward a more literal (and literary) acknowledgment of the source. Think of the high-gloss 1990s productions “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” (directed by Francis Ford Coppola) and “Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein” (directed by Kenneth Branagh): It takes both the budget and the personal leverage of a prestige director, one presumes, to lay claim to the definitive versions of characters who have long been turned over to the public domain. Neither movie did much service to these iconic novels, but show business, as always, carries on: Coppola’s four-decades-in-the-making passion project “Megalopolis,” which wrapped shooting several weeks ago, was funded in part, he has publicly said, by his long-ago work on “Bram Stoker’s Dracula.” And Branagh, having recently mined his own Irish childhood for the dewy black-and-white drama “Belfast” (which won him an Oscar for original screenplay), will next direct and star as Hercule Poirot in his third Agatha Christie adaptation in six years, “A Haunting in Venice,” due this September. Neither he nor Christie is officially billed in the title.

    "27" : """ The New York Philharmonic, saying it hoped to use culture to help ease political tensions, announced plans on Thursday for a summer tour in Asia, including stops in Hong Kong and Taiwan and a visit to mainland China by a small group of musicians.

The tour will be the Philharmonic’s first visit to Asia since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, when many countries in the region shut their borders. It comes amid rising tensions between the United States and China and concerns about the possibility of a crisis over Taiwan.

Gary Ginstling, the Philharmonic’s incoming president and chief executive, said the orchestra hoped to show that music could help strengthen ties between the United States and Asian countries.

“At a time when communication and trust are on the decline, our firm belief is that cultural diplomacy is more important than ever,” he said. “Showing that we can span borders and bring people closer through music is at the heart of our mission.”

After a hiatus during the pandemic, American and European ensembles have in recent months explored returning to Asia, a booming market for classical music before the pandemic.

The Philadelphia Orchestra, the first American ensemble to perform in Communist-led China, is planning to send a delegation of 12 musicians to Beijing and Shanghai this fall. (Last year, the orchestra canceled a tour to celebrate the 50th anniversary of its visit to the country in 1973, worried that China’s then-strict coronavirus protocols would create logistical challenges.)

The Cleveland Orchestra is planning an Asia tour in 2025 that could include a visit to China, as well as Japan and South Korea. The Boston Symphony Orchestra visited Japan last year, the ensemble’s first overseas tour in four years.

The New York Philharmonic’s Asia tour will include performances in late June and early July at the Hong Kong Cultural Center as well as performing arts centers in Taipei and Kaohsiung, a city in southern Taiwan. The orchestra will perform Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony, Dvorak’s Ninth Symphony, Tchaikovsky’s Sixth Symphony and Brahms’s Violin Concerto, featuring the violinist Hilary Hahn.

Hong Kong is familiar terrain for the Philharmonic’s music director, Jaap van Zweden, who also leads the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra.

“I look forward to sharing the work of my New York musical family with audiences in both Taiwan and Hong Kong,” van Zweden said in a statement.

The pandemic forced the Philharmonic to cancel three previously scheduled trips to China, where it has had a partnership with the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra since 2014. Following the visit to Hong Kong in July, a delegation of nine Philharmonic players will go to Shanghai for six days, where they will lead chamber music concerts and teach classes.

The Philharmonic is also working to strengthen ties with Taiwanese cultural groups; on Friday, it will present a concert at David Geffen Hall by the Taiwan Philharmonic.

Ginstling said the orchestra was considering a full tour in mainland China in the summer of 2024.

“It’s too early to commit to that,” he said. “But we’ve certainly made it clear to our friends in Shanghai that when the circumstances warrant and enable it, we will resume our visits with the full orchestra.”

    "28" : """ Helen Barolini, a novelist, essayist and poet who explored the challenges of assimilation, as well as the hard-won victories of feminist emancipation experienced by Italian American women, died on March 29 at her home in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. She was 97.

Her death was confirmed by her daughter Teodolinda Barolini.

A native of Syracuse, N.Y., whose grandparents immigrated from southern Italy in the late 19th century, Ms. Barolini brought their journey, and those of many others, to life in “Umbertina,” her celebrated 1979 historical novel tracing four generations of women in a single Italian American family as they come to terms with their origins and identity in a new land, and with an ever-changing social landscape.

“It is the Madonna of Italian American literature in that it shows the transition from the Italian immigrant to American citizen like no other book of its genre,” Fred Gardaphé, then the director of Italian American studies at SUNY Stony Brook on Long Island and now a professor at the City University of New York, was quoted as saying in an article in The New York Times in 1999, when the book was reissued.

Throughout Ms. Barolini’s career, her work was animated by the belief that Italian American women were underrepresented, not only as subjects in American literature but also as authors, and that as a group they faced what she called a “double erasure, both as Italians and as women,” Teodolinda Barolini said in a phone interview.

Committed throughout her life to promoting Italian poetry and literature, she always sought to broaden the depictions of her people in popular culture beyond “Sopranos”-style stereotypes, while giving voice to those previously unheard.

Such beliefs inspired her influential 1985 compilation of short fiction, memoirs and poems, “The Dream Book: An Anthology of Writings by Italian American Women.”

“I think Italian American literature belongs, interestingly enough, not so much in immigrant literature but in the kind of literature that deals with the outsider,” she said in a 1993 interview published in Melus, a journal devoted to multiethnic literature. “Jews have done this, and Blacks have done this; and they have very pronounced figures — very interesting figures that they have created of the isolated person in an alien society.”

“The Blacks, the Jews, the Irish all have their spokesmen,” she added. “Why not the Italians?”

Helen Frances Mollica was born on Nov. 18, 1925, the eldest of three children of Anthony Mollica, the son of Sicilian immigrants and a self-made man who built a thriving fruit importation and distribution business, and Angela (Cardamone) Mollica, the daughter of immigrants from Calabria.

A gifted student throughout her youth, Ms. Barolini graduated with honors from Syracuse University in 1947, and afterward traveled to Italy to study its culture, history and literature. The next year, she met her future husband, the esteemed Italian novelist and poet Antonio Barolini, in Florence.

The couple married in 1950, had three daughters, and spent a decade bouncing between Italy and the United States, where Ms. Barolini earned a master’s degree in library science from Columbia University. She also worked as a translator of Italian literature, including her husband’s short stories, which were published in English in The New Yorker.

In those early years, “I saw my husband as the more important writer,” she told Melus. “It was after I began to get more in touch with myself that I said, ‘Wait a minute, I want to write. I don’t want to just be the carrier of someone else’s voice.’”

With a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, Ms. Barolini began work on “Umbertina.” The seed of the idea came on a 1965 trip to Calabria, where she discovered a heart-shaped tin sewing kit like those used by rural Italian women in her grandmother’s day.

Taking the time and setting as a starting point, she meticulously researched the historical conditions of each era portrayed in the book, and infused the narrative with a feminist sensibility owing to Betty Friedan, the author of the landmark 1963 book “The Feminine Mystique,” and others. While outwardly a tale of diaspora, “I still think that ‘Umbertina’ is more a feminist statement,” Ms. Barolini later said.

In addition to her daughter Teodolinda, Ms. Barolini is survived by two other daughters, Nicoletta and Susanna Barolini; a brother, Anthony Mollica Jr.; and five grandchildren.

In later books like “Chiaroscuro: Essays on Identity” and “Their Other Side: Six American Women and the Lure of Italy,” Ms. Barolini returned to the subjects and themes that propelled “Umbertina.”

“Theirs was an epic in American life, and it should be written,” she said in the Melus interview, referring to immigrant women like her forebears, “for they who lived it kept no diaries. But we descendants can write and tell, and it’s time now before the last of them die out.”

    "29" : """ There is a feeling of total bodily stimulation in Times Square — the visual excess of signage and language that ‌threatens to overwhelm you, the buzzing artificial light that can shake you upright. For Chryssa, the mononymous, ‌Athens-born artist, th‌at experience, on her first night in New York City in 1955, when she was 21 and still focused on painting, was catalytic. In its pulsating lights and screaming advertisements she saw profound poetry; as she put it to a reporter a decade later: “Times Square I knew had this great wisdom — it was Homeric.”

Those few square blocks propelled her own series of experiments with electric light, neon and industrial materials into dizzyingly beautiful wall reliefs of commercial sign fragments, interrogating consumerist ideology with easily-had materials, ideas that the Pop artists and Minimalists would take another few years to get to, and that put her at the fore of the period’s avant-garde. ‌

By 1961 Chryssa was exhibiting at the Betty Parsons Gallery and had a solo show at the Guggenheim. Two years later, she was part of “Americans 1963” at the Museum of Modern Art alongside Robert Indiana, Claes Oldenburg and Ad Reinhardt. But time has been unkind to her legacy. Like Agnes Martin, with whom Chryssa shared an intimate friendship and whose work too has only recently been reappraised, she slipped from the art world’s consciousness. (It didn’t help that the complexity of conserving 50-year-old wiring makes for a tougher sell than a tidy painting.) There hasn’t been a major Chryssa exhibition ‌in this country since 1982, a breach happily cured by “Chryssa & New York,” a survey organized by the Dia Art Foundation and the Menil Collection‌ that has opened at Dia’s Chelsea gallery.

With 62 works, the show, curated by Megan Holly Witko of Dia and Michelle White from the Menil, does not mean to be exhaustive‌; ‌it nimbly survey‌s Chryssa’s fluidity (in addition to her human-scale, electrified sculptures, there are examples in plaster, bronze, marble and terra-cotta) and argu‌es successfully for her place in art’s firmament.

Chryssa Vardea-Mavromichali was born in Athens in 1933 and grew up amid the Nazi occupation of Greece, where she recalled seeing the cryptic messages scrawled on walls by Greece’s underground resistance, an introduction to the elastic potential of language that colored her work. Her wartime experience led her to become a social worker in the early 1950s, but she soon tired of government obstinacy.

She traveled to Paris, taking art classes at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière and stalking museums, where she first encountered American art, attracted to what she viewed as its lack of history. America was, “I thought at the time, a country of barbarians,” she said in a 1967 interview. “Self-expression was more possible.” Chryssa’s enchantment with the grime of Times Square was somewhat left-handed this way, alive to its beauty but not entirely romantic. She recognized in it the vulgarity of America, and took that as a kind of freedom — “How can you work next to the Parthenon?” she posed to a reporter in 1962.

Chryssa’s practice connect‌ed with Minimalism’s strategies of removing the artist’s hand and using non-art materials. She often worked with glassblowers and welders, scavenging her materials from scrap yards and haunting the plumbing suppliers along Canal Street. But where her peers could be petulant (Dan Flavin despised being called a light artist, demeaning it as technofetishism) or myopic in rejecting the past, Chryssa approached the newness of her art with an openness that made room for classicism.

Chryssa’s first blush with Times Square ignited an abiding fascination with the way language’s delivery can be augmented, and her earliest work with light seeks to exploit its complicity in that process. ‌At Dia, her “Projections,” sculptural arrangements of raised spikes that sprout from their cast aluminum surfaces, as if by photosynthesis, create ‌the suggestion of arrows, letters or the patterns of birds in flight. They riff on the ancient Greek advancements of the sundial, making natural light part of their deal, allowing ‌their surfaces to shift and dance as a viewer moves around them. Chryssa was after something similar with the‌ “Cycladic Books,” serene white-plaster bas-reliefs, cast from the bottoms of cardboard boxes, that flatten the ancient Greek figures to which their title refers into literal tabulae rasae — books whose contents are smoothed into indecipherability.

Both series prod at the limits of language (the “Cycladic Books” are, hauntingly, mute), a concern that finds fuller expression in her series of newspaper prints, canvases densely stamped, often with old printing blocks Chryssa rescued from The New York Times, with the graphic information of a newspaper’s columns, reproduced into ecstatic illegibility. (These were especially pacemaking; Andy Warhol debuted his silk-screens of repeating dollar bills in 1962, the year after Chryssa’s Guggenheim show). The newspaper prints accumulate text to the point of collapse, an acknowledgment of language’s paradox, its capacity to at once reveal and conceal. As she told a reporter in 1966, “I have always felt that when things are spelled out they mean less, and when fragmented they mean more.”

That effect is wittily illustrated in “Times Square Sky” (1962), a writhing wall relief of clamoring aluminum letterforms suffocating one another. Floating at the top, inset in icy electric blue, is the word “air,” as in the argon gas passing through the tube — a canny bit of self-reflexive wordplay that allows the piece to describe itself — and the familiar relief of pushing your way on 42nd Street into an inch of personal space.

lso here is “The Gates to Times Square” (1964-66), the artist’s masterwork, a hulking paean to the city’s street-level energy and the complete expression of her original encounter, which took ‌a decade to metabolize. “The Gates” condenses that thrum into a 10-by-10-foot exploded cube of stainless steel, plexiglass and neon tubing. It absorbs the very stuff of the city‌ — its slick modernist skyscrapers and tangles of scaffolding, the orderliness of its grid system‌ — but also its psychic effects: its vertiginous density, jumble of languages, and the cascading come-ons and entreaties of storefront signage. Newly restored, the sculpture buzzes in a far corner like an altar to some neon god, at once ominous and magnetic.

“The Gates” calls back to its heraldic forebears — the Lion Gate in Mycenae, Greece; Hadrian’s Arch; the Brandenburg Gate; Shinto temple torii — as though you could access another realm by passing through its portal. (‌You could actually do this at its debut at Pace, in 1966, where the spacing of its four bisected monoliths was a bit more generous.) But like the newspaper prints, the torqued signage and neon lettering of “The Gates” is abstracted into uselessness, suggesting an articulation of the limitless possibilities of interpretation, maybe, or how infrequently we succeed in understanding one another.

At Dia, “The Gates” is attended to by smaller neon works that Chryssa considered studies‌ — coils of tubing set inside plexiglass boxes tinted the color of smoke, meant to recreate the particular behavior of Times Square light at night, the way its polluted haze remains suspended in air. One of the best of these, “Study for the Gates #2,” exploits neon’s seductive ‌power and inverts it, courtesy of a timer, cycling for what feels like an eternity (27 seconds) and blinking for a two-second gasp before throwing the whole thing back into darkness. What is revealed is hardly as important as being made to wait for it‌: a pile of wires and rheostats transformed into a sculpture that breathes in an endless night.

Neon is an effective metaphor for America: a shorthand for its technological advancement and its failure to produce progress, forfeited to market consumer products, an idea visualized by Times Square with disorientating efficiency. But while Chryssa was suspicious of mass communication, ‌she wasn’t resigned to its inevitability. By dismantling language, she identified its obscuring methods and offered an alternative, surpassing its chaos with her own, freer grammar. “The Gates” can be viewed as a homage to Times Square but also an exit from it, an understanding that the only way out is to elbow your way through.
