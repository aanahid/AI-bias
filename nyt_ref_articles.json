    "1": """Every day this week, hundreds of visitors to the National Gallery in London have marveled at “After Impressionism” — an acclaimed exhibition examining how, at the turn of the 20th century, painters including Van Gogh, Cézanne and Picasso pushed art in bold new directions.

So, too, have art lovers visiting an institution 1,700 miles away: the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, in Moscow.
    
Before Russia invaded Ukraine, the two museums were collaborating on a single “After Impressionism” show, which would bring together masterpieces from each institution’s vast museum holdings. The exhibition was to open in London and then travel to Moscow. Now the shows are divorced; the National Gallery’s version of Cézanne’s “Bathers” will be seen only in London, while Henri Matisse’s “The Pink Studio,” a major painting of bright color and vivid decoration from 1911, will stay put in Moscow.

Over the past year, the National Gallery’s curators searched worldwide for paintings and sculptures to replace the 15 masterpieces that had been expected from Russia. The Pushkin’s curators, in turn, refocused its “After Impressionism,” which opened on Tuesday, toward Russian artists. Last year, Olga Lyubimova, Russia’s culture minister, said it was vital that exhibitions that had been planned with foreign museums went ahead, even when those museums now refused to loan works to Russia.

At a time when Western opera houses and concert halls are grappling with whether to resume work with Russian singers and musicians, the bifurcated “After Impression” exhibition shows that Western museums are holding firm in deciding to cut off Russian state institutions until the war is over. Although phone calls between colleagues on both sides continue, Russian museums are otherwise sealed off from Western influences and partnerships.

In recent statements, Russia’s culture ministry has downplayed the impact of isolation, and trumpeted potential cultural collaborations with nations that have not condemned the war, including China, Oman, and even Cuba.

MaryAnne Stevens, the lead curator of the National Gallery’s “After Impressionism,” said in an interview that the situation felt like a throwback to the 1970s, when Westerners struggled to borrow from Russia’s incredible collections of art and were hampered in academic research. “It’s deeply depressing and very saddening,” she said.

That sense of Russia being shut off has only grown in recent weeks as the government changed the leadership at several of Moscow’s biggest museums, pushing out directors that promoted joint projects with Western institutions.

Last month, Marina Loshak, the Pushkin’s longtime director and a driving force behind the joint “After Impressionism” show, resigned after 10 years in the role.

In a statement on the Puskin’s social media accounts, she said it was time for a new director “to come with new energy, with new thoughts and with new ambitions.” But to many in Russia, Loshak’s position had become untenable because her daughter, Anna Mongayt, is an opposition journalist who opposes the war. Loshak said in an interview with The Art Newspaper Russia that she wanted to leave the Pushkin on her own terms. Loshak was replaced by Elizaveta Likhacheva, previously the head of Russia’s Shchusev Museum of Architecture.

In February, there was a similar changing of the guard at the State Tretyakov Gallery, another of Moscow’s major museums, when the culture ministry announced the abrupt dismissal of Zelfira Tregulova, the Tretyakov Gallery’s steadfastly independent director since 2015. She was replaced by Elena Pronicheva, who previously ran the Polytechnic Museum, a science collection, in Moscow.

Under Tregulova’s leadership, the Tretyakov Gallery staged or hosted several surprising contemporary art shows — including one that celebrated diversity and European unity — and lent works from its collection across Europe. In January, the ministry wrote to the museum urging it to do more to promote “traditional Russian spiritual and moral values,” according to a report in The Moscow Times. A few weeks later, the ministry decided not to renew Tregulova’s contract. Tregulova told reporters she learned of the decision in the press.
    
Both Loshak and Tregulova turned down interview requests for this article; the Pushkin and Tretyakov museums did not respond to similar requests.

Catherine Phillips, a British art historian who had worked with the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg since the 1990s, said in an interview that although the changes were stark, they seemed more about the government wanting to show its power over cultural life, rather than seeking to alter the museums’ content or “micromanage the culture.”

Yet there has been a more patriotic turn in the past decade in some of Russia’s museums, particularly its military and historical institutions. Over the past year, Lyubimova, the culture minister, has visited and praised several such shows, including a Moscow exhibition venerating Russia’s warrior saints. The show had perhaps been conceived “in a completely different setting, with a different message,” she said, according to a news release, but it was “all the more providential to open this exhibition today.”

Of all of Russia’s museums, the Hermitage — founded in the 18th century by Catherine the Great, a German princess who became Russia’s empress — has had the greatest ties to Western Europe. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Hermitage recalled numerous loans, including Fabergé eggs at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, paintings at the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris and a Picasso portrait from an Italian museum.

The Hermitage’s director, Mikhail Piotrovsky, remains in place. The museum’s head since 1990, Piotrovsky is close to President Vladimir Putin of Russia and has made statements backing Russia’s invasion. Last year, in an interview with a Russian newspaper, Piotrovsky, said he felt “stabbed in the back” when foreign museums cut ties with his institution.

In an emailed statement, Piotrovsky said “the blockade of Russia’s museums” had forced the museum to change how it operates. “We have been looking into the opportunities for holding exhibitions from private collections and from friendly countries,” he said.

With fewer international tourists, the museum is pivoting to maintain its global presence. Piotrovsky said the Hermitage was becoming more active online, a move that includes offering virtual museum tours. In March, the museum began broadcasting live feeds from webcams trained on of two of its greatest modern masterpieces — Matisse’s “Dance” and “Music” — so that art lovers outside Russia could still see them.

The museum would also work outside Russia by hosting events in Asia, the Middle East and the Balkans, Piotrovsky said, but did not explain what those would involve.

Officially, Russia’s museums may now be looking Eastward, but Vladimir Opredelenov, a former deputy director at the Pushkin Museum, who left after Russia’s invasion, said in an email interview that Western and Russian museums were still collaborating, just in “more veiled and bizarre forms” rather than via official channels.

Once the war’s over, “we will see that museums will be among the first to set an example” and resume cultural exchange, he added, because “both sides equally understand the value of maintaining human relationships.”

Until then, Opredelenov said, Russian museums need to work with countries in the Middle East and Asia to help spread their creativity: “I hope that the world community understands and accepts this.”

    "2": """ The stoops of brownstone Brooklyn, on which residents routinely leave freebies for passers-by, are a reliable metric of current literary tastes — and distastes. In that fervid summer of 2018 when prominent men were being publicly accused of bad behavior right and left, I found there juxtaposed Woody Allen’s “Side Effects” and Garrison Keillor’s “Lake Wobegon Days,” amusing in a way those humorists never intended. Nearby, someone had huffily discarded a copy of Mario Batali’s “Molto Italiano.” My shelf of scandal was getting more stuffed than one of his delectable vongole origanate.

Over on the West Coast, in Seattle, the author Claire Dederer had discovered a similar phenomenon: a Little Free Library “absolutely crammed to its tiny rafters with books by and about” Allen, which she decided to gather as research. “An ill-gotten Woody Allen book was a book I hadn’t paid for — the perfect way to consume the art of someone whose morals you question,” she writes in her own new book, “Monsters: A Fan’s Dilemma,” a cross-disciplinary consideration of such polarizing figures, and of the ethics of a creative life.

“Everyone alive,” Dederer writes, “is either canceled or about to be canceled.” But she has no use for the term “cancel culture,” privileging, as it does, the person shamed by the red stamp of accusation, rather than the one who pipes up about wrongdoing. And she nonetheless wants to find a way to reconcile her appreciation of great art with the real-life misdeeds of its creators.

Expanding on a popular essay published in The Paris Review a month after the exposure of Harvey Weinstein’s sexual predation, “Monsters” sustains an essayistic, sometimes aphoristic tone throughout 250-odd pages. Dotted with details of her particular milieu — the ferryboat, the crepe shop, the rock show that leaves glitter in the eyelashes — “Monsters” is part memoir, part treatise and all treat. Dederer is continually trying — not in the adjectival sense, but as the present participle: showing us her thought process, correcting as she goes and experimenting with different forms.

She renders an argument with an unnamed tweedy “male writer” about Allen’s 1979 movie “Manhattan,” for example, as a “little play” set in the marble-lined restaurant at the Met Breuer (itself an echt “Manhattan” setting), observing “a clink of silverware around the room, as if the knives and forks were having another conversation, a clearer and cleaner conversation, underneath or above the meaty human rumble.”

Dederer, the “female writer” — and a nimble, witty one — has come to believe that the nonchalance with which Allen’s character dates a high schooler ruins the film, which has always faintly disturbed her, especially since the director left Mia Farrow for her daughter Soon-Yi Previn. The male writer takes the New Critical position that she should judge “Manhattan” just on aesthetics, and that it’s a masterpiece.

Woody Allen has already taken up too much space in this review. The so-called monster — a term that, handily, can denote success and size as well as deviance — has a way of doing that.

Dederer flips through an entire rogues’ gallery, which includes plenty of men yet also a surprising number of women: J.K. Rowling, of course, whose Harry Potter series had enraptured Dederer’s family before she spoke about transgender issues; but also Virginia Woolf, whose diaries were “pocked” with “flippant antisemitic remarks” though she was married to a Jew; Willa Cather, who dehumanized Black people in “My Ántonia”; Laura Ingalls Wilder, who dehumanized Native Americans in the “Little House” series; and Doris Lessing, who left two children behind when she moved from Rhodesia to London with the third.

“This is what female monstrousness looks like: abandoning the kids. Always,” declares Dederer, a mother of two still feeling guilty about a decade of drinking and a five-week retreat to Marfa, Texas. Here I’d argue with her (and I don’t think she’d mind; she is continually arguing with herself). Unless not having children, like Woolf, constitutes a kind of abandonment?

“Monster” turns out to be but one of several words the author carefully palpates, finding it “male, testicular, old world. It’s a hairy word, and has teeth.” It conjures childhood fear and fantasy, like the creatures in “Where the Wild Things Are,” whose author, Maurice Sendak, is in some quarters absurdly demonized, or the works of Roald Dahl: less absurdly demonized, for unflippant antisemitism. (“If we give up the antisemites,” remarks one of Dederer’s friends in what is actually kind of a Woody Allenish joke, “we’ll have to give up everyone.” )

“Am I a Monster?” Dederer titles one chapter, assessing her own relative rectitude. In the next breath, she assesses her own career — she has published well-received books on yoga and sex — “maybe I’m not monstrous enough.” Art requires selfishness; geniuses get a “hall pass” on having to conform to society’s expectations. If only one could keep the passionate, voracious part of monsterdom without leaving teeth marks in other people.

“Stain” is another piece of vocabulary Dederer finds useful, though Philip Roth’s “The Human Stain” is not among the many works analyzed here, and Roth is mentioned only in passing, despite the very interesting case of sexual misconduct accusations against his biographer that has jeopardized Roth’s legacy.

Maybe that’s because “biography,” to Dederer, seems not so much noble genre as ubiquitous nuisance, a “disrupter of my own pleasure”: just a set of personal details you can search for on that most monstrous of modern entities, the internet. “We swim in biography; we are sick with biography,” she writes. It “used to be something you sought out, yearned for, actively pursued. Now it falls on your head all day long.”

Corollary to the “monster,” more passive, is the “stain”: some ugliness coloring someone’s life that you don’t want to know, that nonetheless spreads and can ruin perception of his or her work. Stains seep through time, to the people who hurt the artist and the people the artist hurt, and in these days of heightened parasocial relationships, the people he or she hurts include us: the fan who knew too much.

Every fan’s shelf of scandal, the books  snatched furtively off the stoop, looks different. Dederer’s: light on Roth, laden with Vladimir Nabokov. Her exquisitely reasoned vindication of “Lolita” brought tears of gratitude to my eyes.

But I also found myself disagreeing with or questioning a lot, resisting her sweeping “we” (a pronoun she herself interrogates). I don’t think of the comedian Michael Richards’s 2006 racist tirade every time I catch glimpses of him bursting through the door on “Seinfeld.” (Should I?) Neither, presumably, does the hilarious young comedian Troy Bond, who regularly does a modernized parody of the show on TikTok.

I don’t think the word “ambition” attached to a woman is pejorative anymore. I don’t think women who complete their work — “finishers,” Dederer calls them — are in any way monstrous or comparable to male predators. They’re A students! Or just being professional.

And I definitely don’t think, as she asserts, that “pregnancy is the end of narrative.” This from someone who spends pages luxuriating guiltily in “Rosemary’s Baby,” trying to solve “the problem of Roman Polanski.”  What about John Updike’s “Couples”? (Don’t get me started on how The London Review of Books monsterized Updike, above Patricia Lockwood’s essay, as a “malfunctioning sex robot.”)

For an author who rightly shudders over the cheapening of the word “obsessed” to use the phrases “make work” — the new “make love”? — and “late capitalism” leaves me feeling, as Dederer would herself put it, “a little urpy.”

But, but … this is a book that looks boldly down the cliff at the roiling waters below and jumps right in, splashes around playfully, isn’t afraid to get wet. How refreshing.

    "3":""" On a recent sunny morning on the banks of the Adda River in northern Italy, schoolchildren on a class trip to Imbersago — the “Town of the Ferry of Leonardo da Vinci” — gathered next to a moored boat and listened as a guide explained how the flights of the river’s birds, the formations of its rocks and the workings of its ships inspired Leonardo’s genius.

“Why doesn’t it move?” one of the students interrupted, pointing to the ferry, which sat behind a chain and a sign reading, “Service suspended.” It looked like a deserted summer deck atop two rowboats.

“The water needs to be high enough for the current to move it,” answered Sara Asperti, 45. “Also, they’re looking for a new ferryman. So if any of you are interested.”

Since at least 500 years ago, when the opposing banks of the Adda belonged to the Duchy of Milan and the Republic of Venice, ferries have run on water currents and a taut rope above a narrow stretch of the river. Leonardo spent a lot of time in the area and sketched the motorless ferry around 1513. Later, the invention of the ferry, or its improvement, was attributed to him, though locals say no one knows for sure.

In the past century, reproductions of the original ferries have linked Italy’s Lecco and Bergamo Provinces, allowing knitwear factory workers to commute, a young Pope John XXIII to visit a favorite shrine and, more recently, tourists and cyclists to enjoy the nature paths and yellow fields of rapeseed.

But a year after Italy’s worst drought in seven decades — when much of Europe gasped for precipitation — a winter without much rain or snow has turned into a dry spring across the country’s north. In Piedmont, water tanks are already supplying a small mountain village with drinking water. The Po River valley, usually lush and rich in rice, is parched. In March, a member of Parliament brandished river stones that he collected from the dry Adige River to accuse Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of inaction.

“I’m not Moses,” she responded.

This month, the government established a task force to tackle the scarcity of rainfall, which has also hit the Adda, where swans glide on water so low that islands have emerged, rowboats are beached and the last of what the town calls “Leonardesque” ferries has become a stationary landmark.

“If it becomes a monument, or something static, it loses its meaning,” said Fabio Vergani, Imbersago’s mayor, as he sat on the ferry, big enough to hold three cars or scores of people, but now empty. The boat was a tourist draw and an economic engine, he said, but more important, it was “the family jewel of the town — we cannot be left without it.”

The painful case of the ferry, the mayor said, was “evidence of a global problem.” He continued: “It’s not science fiction. We are feeling the real effects. What was the problem of North Africa is maybe going to be the reality of southern Europe. A lack of rain and desertification of the territory.”

But some of the townspeople say an Italian problem more daunting than climate change is the real culprit for the ferry’s immobility since May.

“Bureaucracy,” said John Codara, who owns the gelato shop next to the ferry.

Since the last ferry operators left to run a more lucrative water taxi in Lake Como, no one has bid to take over the 4,500-euro-a-year concession, even though the town has thrown in a mountain bike rental as a deal sweetener.

The mayor says no one wants to operate the ferry because it cannot function with weak currents, and tried to explain as much to Mr. Codara in his cafe. But the gelato maker wasn’t buying it. After the mayor left, Mr. Codara, who fielded calls from interested locals — “You should see the hair on this guy,” he said, cupping the phone — remained convinced that the engineering of the ferry could handle low water.

“I mean Leonardo wasn’t a moron,” he said, under a framed picture of Leonardo. He demonstrated how the ferry worked on a small wooden model made by a local pensioner — “It’s to scale; it’s worth 500 euros,” or nearly $550, and argued that low water and weak currents meant operators required elbow grease to move it across the cable connecting the two banks.

“The force of the ferry is these,” Mr. Codara said, pointing at his biceps.

What they did not need was an advanced nautical degree, he said, as he marched out of his cafe and made a beeline for a sign honoring “The Human Face of the Ferry” and its pilots over the past century. “Harvard, Harvard, Harvard,” Mr. Codara said with derision as he pointed at the names. “They all went to Harvard.”

Roberto Spada, 75, whose father was one of those ferrymen, said he helped navigate the ferry as a 12-year-old and was interested in helping out the town by doing it again as a volunteer.

“I thought with my license I could do it,” Mr. Spada told the mayor as they leaned against other signs posted next to the ferry that featured both Leonardo’s sketch and an excerpt from Dante’s “Inferno” about Charon, “ferryman of the damned.”

A retired truck driver and president of the local fishing association — which has the ferry as its logo — Mr. Spada had a boating license but seemed bewildered as the mayor explained all of the certifications and bureaucratic hoops that needed to be jumped through to pilot the ferry.

“It’s a really long process,” said Mr. Vergani, the mayor.

In the meantime, the river is at one of its lowest depths in decades.

Volunteers tending to flower beds along the riverbank were finding the dirt so dry that they put down their hoes and used a leaf blower to tidy up. Cyclists stepped over the chain, their biking shoes clicking on the ferry platform, to commiserate about the low level of the river. One of them, Roberto Valsecchi, 63, who recalled crossing with his car on the ferry as a teenager, worried that the paltry snowfall on the ski slopes this winter meant “we will suffer this summer.”

Mr. Vergani worried that even if the skies opened, officials at Lake Como, which fed the river, would hoard the water and “keep the tap closed” to ensure the lake’s own survival. The situation looked bleak. The area’s hydroelectric plants had already started rationing water.

Giuseppina Di Paola, 64, paused from feeding geese to talk about how she used to take her mountain bike on the ferry, but now walked along the banks, where “I found a lot of dead fish.”

Flavio Besana, 70, an environmental guard of the local park, was spending his day off walking the centuries-old path beside the river. He pointed to the boulders considered the inspiration for the landscape in Leonardo’s “Virgin of the Rocks.”

“All of that is usually covered with water,” Mr. Besana said, pointing at the bottom of the boulder. “In 40 years, I’ve never seen the river like this.”

Near Imbersago’s small town center, the roundabout is adorned with a large wooden model of the ferry. The loss of the main attraction means tourism on the weekdays has slowed to a trickle. Valentino Riva, 66, whose father was a ferryman in the 1970s, ironed shirts in the dry-cleaning shop off the main square and recalled more buoyant days.

“There used to be people in the piazza,” he said, as the iron hissed. “Those times are finished.”

Evening fell and the day’s gentle breeze died down, leaving the river as still as a tar pit. Across the water, on the Bergamo side, Angela Maestroni, 64, sat with her husband next to Leonardo da Vinci Street and in front of the small port where the ferry no longer goes. They reminisced about commuting on the ferry, watched the birds and fretted about the future.

“It’s months that it doesn’t rain,” she said. “The summers are so much hotter. Last year, the sun burned everything.”

Just then, a light drizzle fell from the sky, pockmarking the river and spotting the ferry platform on the other shore. Then, just as suddenly, it stopped and the sky cleared.

“It’s two drops,” she said. “It’s not enough.”

    "5" : """ At least four major suppliers of Hyundai Motor Co and sister Kia Corp have employed child labor at Alabama factories in recent years, a Reuters investigation found, and state and federal agencies are probing whether kids have worked at as many as a half dozen additional manufacturers throughout the automakers’ supply chain in the southern U.S. state.

At a plant owned by Hwashin America Corp, a supplier to the two car brands in the south Alabama town of Greenville, a 14-year-old Guatemalan girl worked this May assembling auto body components, according to interviews with her father and law enforcement officials. At plants owned by Korean auto-parts maker Ajin Industrial Co, in the east Alabama town of Cusseta, a former production engineer told Reuters he worked with at least 10 minors. And six other ex-employees of Ajin said they, too, worked alongside multiple underage laborers.

In two separate statements sent by the same public relations firm, Hwashin and Ajin said their policies forbid the hiring of any worker not of legally employable age. Using identical language, both companies said they hadn’t, “to the best of our knowledge,” hired underage workers.

The employment of children at Hwashin and Ajin hasn’t been previously reported. The news follows a Reuters report in July that revealed the use of child workers, one as young as 12, by SMART Alabama LLC, a Hyundai subsidiary in the south Alabama town of Luverne. In August, the U.S. Department of Labor said that SL Alabama LLC, another Hyundai supplier and a unit of South Korea’s SL Corp, employed underage workers, including a 13-year-old, at its factory in Alexander City.

Since then, as many as 10 Alabama plants that supply parts to Hyundai or Kia have been investigated for child labor by various state and federal law enforcement or regulatory agencies, according to two people familiar with the probes. The investigations are being conducted across small towns and rural outposts where many of the suppliers and the job recruiters that staff them are located. It isn’t yet clear whether the probes will lead to criminal charges, fines or other penalties, the two people said.

On Aug. 22 a team of Labor Department and Alabama state inspectors arrived unannounced at one of Ajin’s plants, according to people familiar with the operation. As the team arrived, workers rushed out the back and left the premises before they could be questioned, one of the inspectors told a meeting of Alabama’s anti-human trafficking task force last month, according to two people who attended. The inspection hasn’t previously been reported.

A Labor Department spokesman, Eric Lucero, told Reuters that the agency’s Wage and Hour Division has an open investigation into Ajin, but declined to confirm whether the probe was related to child labor.

In its statement, Ajin said it “will cooperate fully” with any investigations by regulators and law enforcement. Hyundai, in a statement, told Reuters it “does not condone or tolerate violations of labor law” and requires that “our suppliers and business partners strictly adhere to the law.” Kia, for its part, said it “strongly condemns any practice of child labor and does not tolerate any unlawful or unethical workplace practices internally or within our business partners and suppliers.”

Hyundai and Kia, South Korea’s two largest automakers, are sister companies controlled by parent Hyundai Motor Group. Both companies told Reuters they are reviewing hiring practices used by their suppliers.

The discovery of child labor at additional plants in Hyundai’s American supply chain could deal a fresh reputational blow to a company whose fast growth and popularity in recent years has led it to become the third-largest automaker by U.S. sales. The earlier reports of child labor drew law enforcement and regulatory scrutiny to the company’s ability to meet its own professed ethical standards and comply with basic labor regulations in the United States.

In-house human rights policies, posted by both brands online, prohibit child labor at Hyundai and Kia facilities and among their suppliers, too. Alabama and U.S. law restrict factory work for people under age 16, and all workers under 18 are forbidden from many hazardous jobs in auto plants, where metal presses, cutting machines and speeding forklifts can endanger life and limb.

After the earlier reporting by Reuters on child labor at suppliers SMART and SL, Hyundai’s chief operating officer, José Muñoz, told the news agency he ordered the carmaker’s purchasing department to cease business with the suppliers named in the news reports “as soon as possible.” He also said the company would investigate all suppliers to Hyundai's Alabama operations. Hyundai, Muñoz added, would seek to end the use of third-party staffing agencies that many of its suppliers have relied upon to vet and hire workers.

Hyundai is now backing away from Muñoz’s remarks.

In its recent statement to Reuters, Hyundai said it has canceled its plans to cut off suppliers where minors have worked. Two of its suppliers, SMART and SL, have taken “corrective actions” to fire staffing agencies they found problematic, it said. Noting the “important economic role” that parts makers play in many small Alabama towns, Hyundai added, “additional oversight is a better course at this time than severing ties with these suppliers.”

Hyundai declined to make COO Muñoz available for a follow-up interview.

The use of third-party staffing agencies is a common practice among manufacturers and other labor-intensive sectors throughout the United States. The tactic has long been criticized by labor activists because it gives factory owners and other employers the ability to outsource responsibility for the screening, hiring and regulatory compliance of their workforces.


Earlier this year, Reuters showed how staffing agencies in rural Alabama recruited undocumented workers from Central America, including minors who had entered the U.S. without parents or guardians, and supplied them to chicken processing plants. As with those minors, at least some of the children who worked at Hyundai suppliers used false identities and documentation obtained through black-market brokers, sometimes with the help of staffing firms themselves.

To understand how child labor took root in the supply chain of one of the world’s most successful automakers and in the job market of the world’s richest country, Reuters interviewed more than 100 current and former factory workers and managers, labor recruiters, state and federal officials, and others. Reporters spent weeks around auto parts factories in rural Alabama and reviewed thousands of pages of court records, corporate documents, police reports and other records.

“It’s shocking,” David Weil, a former administrator of the Wage and Hour Division of the Labor Department, said of the signs of widespread child factory work. “The ages involved, the danger of what they are being employed to do, it’s a clear violation.”

Across Alabama, a sprawling and partially interconnected network of suppliers and staffing agencies, many Korean-owned, exists to serve the Hyundai brands. Hyundai operates an assembly plant in Montgomery, the state capital. Kia builds cars across the state line in West Point, Georgia. Both states, so-called “right to work” jurisdictions whose laws allow workers to reject unions and thereby undercut the power of organized labor, have attracted numerous automakers and follow-on investments, as recently as this year, granting them billions of dollars in tax breaks and other incentives along the way.

A key element of Hyundai’s supply network is its ability to provide “just-in-time” delivery of parts, a staple of modern manufacturing meant to minimize stockpiles of materials. To avoid halting assembly lines, Hyundai can fine suppliers – sometimes thousands of dollars per minute – for any delay, according to people familiar with its operations. Pressure to deliver, several current and former employees at suppliers told Reuters, intensified in recent years because of the labor and supply shortages that crippled manufacturers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The struggle to meet demand, labor law experts say, has increased chances that employers cut corners to keep assembly lines staffed, whether employees are legally allowed to work or not. “It seems like the stage was set for this to happen,” said Terri Gerstein, director of the state and local enforcement project at Harvard Law School’s Labor and Worklife Program. “Plants in remote, rural areas. A region with low union density. Not enough regulatory enforcement. Use of staffing agencies.” The shortage of labor across manufacturing, and the low pay offered by some plants and agents for factory jobs, often attract job candidates most pressed for work – particularly undocumented migrants and minors. “When you have workers who are desperate for jobs and they’re not empowered and you have a lot of competition, you often see a race to the bottom,” said Jordan Barab, a former deputy assistant secretary at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the federal workplace regulator.

So far, SL, the manufacturer in the central Alabama town of Alexander City, is the only Hyundai or Kia supplier charged with violating child labor laws. On Aug. 9, state and federal labor and law enforcement officials found seven workers between the ages of 13 and 16 on the SL factory floor, according to people familiar with the operation and government documents. The U.S. Labor Department in a court filing said SL Alabama had “repeatedly violated” the law “by employing oppressive child labor.” It fined the company about $30,000. Alabama’s Department of Labor fined SL and one of its staffing agencies a total of about $36,000.

SL told Reuters in October it was cooperating with investigators and auditing its employment policies. The company said it had terminated the staffing agency fined by Alabama labor regulators and fired the president of SL’s Alexander City plant. The plant’s former president couldn’t be reached for comment.

Among the children found working at the plant, Reuters learned, were two Guatemalan brothers, aged 13 and 15, who were taken into protective custody by federal authorities. While they worked at SL, the brothers lived without their parents, staying with other factory workers in a sparsely furnished house owned by the president of the staffing agency that hired them, according to property records, family members, and a former coworker interviewed at the home in Alabama. A teenage cousin who worked at the factory with the brothers said that no one at SL ever verified workers’ ages. “They didn’t ask any questions,” the cousin said. Reuters isn’t naming the cousin and other minors and undocumented migrants interviewed for this story, but confirmed their identities and local employment history with authorities.

Since Reuters’ first report on child labor in Hyundai’s supply chain, staffing firms have fired foreign workers from at least five factories, current and former employees said, particularly any who appeared too young to legally work in the plants. The dismissals make it harder for authorities to investigate, officials said, because the employees may have been working under aliases and some moved away after being fired. Hyundai opened its massive Montgomery vehicle assembly plant in December 2005. The Georgia Kia factory, 100 miles to the east, opened five years later. To support the two brands, many of Hyundai’s suppliers from Korea set up in the area, building parts factories that revived local economies. Hyundai and Kia now have dozens of suppliers in Alabama, according to the Economic Development Partnership of Alabama, a business group. Authorities first caught wind of child labor among automotive suppliers in early 2021. A school official in Alabama’s rural Butler County told state officials that some children – including at least one immigrant girl around 12 years old – appeared to be working at Hwashin, the parts maker in Greenville. The manufacturer, which builds metallic body parts in a factory the size of four football fields, is now the biggest employer in a town once better known for cotton farming.

After the tip, officials familiar with the matter told Reuters they began examining Hwashin. The tipster and the officials spoke on condition they not be identified by name or by agency.

Even as authorities were investigating, a 14-year-old migrant was recruited to the factory floor at Hwashin. The girl’s father said he and his daughter arrived in Alabama four years earlier, after a long trek from Guatemala. The teen looks younger than her age. On a visit to their home, a small house shared with other migrants south of Greenville, Reuters met the girl, who is just over four feet tall, with rosy cheeks and a timid smile.

Early this year, the father had been working poultry jobs. Troubled by the family’s meager income and hoping to send money to family back in Central America, the girl, who wasn’t attending school, asked her father if she too could get a job, he said. He agreed. “I wish I had said no,” he said.

In April, the father turned to a Spanish-speaking recruiter who was regularly seeking laborers. The recruiter, the father said, worked for a company he knew as JSS, a name familiar in the area as a staffing agency for Hyundai suppliers. Reuters was unable to reach the recruiter. As with many staffing firms, the ownership structure of JSS isn’t entirely clear in public records. A review of more than two dozen labor brokers found a complex web of overlapping companies that form and dissolve quickly to serve Hyundai suppliers.

Two other people, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters they had worked as recruiters for JSS. The agency, they said, hired underage workers while they worked there. Those former recruiters gave Reuters an address in the state capital and said that JSS’s top executive, Jae Kim, often worked there.

In October, Reuters visited the office, located in a Montgomery strip mall. Inside, paperwork and logos for various agencies, including “JSS Staffing,” lay on desks. Javier Martinez, an employee, confirmed in a brief interview that the office is run by a businessman named Jae Kim. He said Kim wasn’t in that day.

On LinkedIn, Jae Kim is listed as chief executive of a staffing firm called Advanced Job Solutions LLC, or AJS. Kim didn’t respond to requests for an interview.

In Greenville, three miles from the Hwashin factory, a storefront for “JSS Staffing” advertised jobs this month in a big window display in Spanish and English. “Estamos contratando!” the sign reads. “NOW HIRING.” A property manager for the site said the office is rented to a company known as Job Supply System LLC.

In a phone call to the Greenville office, an attendant referred Reuters back to Martinez, the employee at Kim’s office in Montgomery. Martinez told Reuters by email that he was responding on behalf of Job Supply Systems Alabama LLC, or JSSA – a slight variation on the name of the company renting the Greenville office. Despite the overlap, the firms are different entities, Martinez wrote. Reuters couldn’t determine if the agencies shared ownership, management structure or any common history.

“JSSA is not affiliated with and has no involvement in the management or operations” of Job Supply System, Martinez wrote. JSSA’s policy, he wrote, is “not to hire, employ, or refer any minor for employment.” The company, he added, was aware of ongoing child labor investigations and “has complied with requests from investigators.”

When the Guatemalan girl’s father contacted the recruiter, he said he asked whether his daughter’s age would be an issue. No, the recruiter told him. On the black market, the girl’s father procured a fake ID, seen by Reuters, that says she is an 18-year-old California resident. The name and picture on the card are the daughter’s, but the birth year is phony.

By May, the father said, he and his daughter were both working at Hwashin, each earning about $11 per hour. That’s higher than the federal minimum wage of $7.25 – Alabama doesn’t impose a state minimum. But the rate is below what many other industrial jobs in the region pay, including poultry processors, where workers usually earn at least $14 per hour.

Father and daughter worked long shifts, commuting 90 minutes each way from their home, the cost of van rides deducted from their weekly pay, the father said. Many staffing agencies operate van fleets and provide transportation to companies for which they recruit labor.

Shortly after father and daughter started, word circulated among factory workers that authorities were planning a crackdown on migrant child labor. It isn’t clear what prompted the rumors. But months earlier, another young girl from Guatemala, who worked at SMART, the Hyundai-owned supplier in nearby Luverne, disappeared briefly with an adult coworker. That girl’s case was detailed in Reuters’ first report about child labor among Hyundai suppliers.

By late May, the father said, his daughter and other minors working at Hwashin were abruptly fired by the staffing agency. “You’ve got to leave,” he said the recruiter told his daughter and other dismissed minors. “The authorities will be arriving here soon.”

The father said he also left Hwashin by early June. At that time, investigators hadn’t appeared. Reuters couldn’t determine whether authorities have visited the plant since. Hwashin said it isn’t aware of any probe of its labor practices and that it would cooperate with any investigation. Some adult factory workers in Alabama’s Hyundai supply chain told Reuters they knew or suspected that children worked alongside them, but feared raising the issue would cost them their jobs.

Raul Roa, a 27-year-old production engineer from Mexico, had arrived in 2020 at the east Alabama town of Cusseta to work at Ajin, one of the two metal stamping plants owned by the Korean parent company of the same name. Roa said Ajin, working with a recruitment firm, secured him a TN visa. The visa, a type of entry permit authorized by a trade agreement with Mexico and Canada, allows highly skilled professionals from those countries to work in the United States. Roa was among many Mexican professionals recruited by Hyundai suppliers in recent years, according to interviews, court records, and company documents reviewed by Reuters.

Shortly after his arrival, Roa said, he began noticing a significant increase in the number of migrant workers recruited locally. Among them, he suspected, were minors. With time, he got to know some of the younger workers. At least 10 told him they were underage, he said, most of them just 15 or 16 years old.

“I was very surprised,” said Roa, who left Ajin earlier this year for a job outside the automotive industry. “It was my first job in the United States and this is not what you would expect to see here.”

Six other former workers told Reuters they, too, saw underage workers at Ajin’s two factories in Cusseta. All six spoke on condition that they not be identified.

One of the six former workers, an American manager at one of Ajin’s plants, told Reuters he did alert superiors last year to the presence of workers who looked underage. A boss at the plant, he said, dismissed his concerns and advised him to “focus on production.”

Reuters was unable to reach the superior. Ajin declined to comment on the manager’s assertion that a superior had ignored his concerns. At SMART, Carlos Herrera, a 29-year-old production engineer, said he heard a similar message.

Like Roa, the Ajin employee, Herrera said he had been recruited by SMART directly from Mexico with a TN visa. After starting at SMART in October 2020, Herrera said he noticed at least 20 young boys and girls working at the plant, many of them from Guatemala. He said some of the minors told him they were between the ages of 12 and 16. They worked under fake names, Herrera said, and did the same jobs as adults, some of them even driving forklifts and operating welding equipment.

In January, Herrera said, he saw a 16-year-old forklift driver sprain his hand after a fall. Another teen, he said, also fell around that time and injured his elbow. Herrera said he raised concerns about the underage workers with managers at SMART, but was brushed off. “I would tell them: This person shouldn’t be working,” he said. “But they didn’t care.”

SMART, in a statement provided by the same public relations firm hired by the other parts makers, said it cut ties with a staffing agency that supplied it with one underage worker. It said it was “unaware of any evidence” that any other firm had supplied “an employee who was not of legally employable age.” SMART didn’t respond to questions about the injuries Herrera said he saw minors incur at its plant.

SMART makes interior components for popular Hyundai models including the Santa Fe and Elantra, and is majority-owned by the carmaker.

Herrera said on several occasions he saw personnel from Hyundai visit the plant. Other former SMART employees also told Reuters Hyundai officials regularly visited the factory. The officials, wearing shirts that bore Hyundai logos, inspected the assembly line even as underage workers labored there, Herrera said. “I don’t know if they were paying attention to people’s faces,” he said, “but it was obvious there were minors.”

Hyundai didn’t respond to questions about the company’s visits to SMART or whether its officials saw underage workers there.

Herrera left SMART earlier this year and is in the process of joining a class action lawsuit filed by a group of TN visa holders against the company and several recruiting firms. The workers allege SMART and its staffing agencies recruited them abroad to come work as engineers but instead assigned them to rote assembly work at the factory. SMART in court documents has called the suit baseless. After Reuters documented the disappearance of the young girl who worked at SMART, a team of state and federal authorities conducted the Aug. 9 inspection at SL, in Alexander City. They discovered seven minors there, including the two Guatemalan brothers, among employees making lights and mirrors for Hyundai and Kia. Alabama’s Department of Labor fined SL and JK USA Inc, a staffing agency, $17,800 each.

A state penalty letter against JK is addressed to a top executive of the staffing agency: “Sam Hong – President.” Alabama property records show the house where the two brothers lived with other SL workers is owned by a company registered in Sam Hong’s name. By email this week, Hong said JK is conducting an “internal investigation.” He declined to answer detailed questions about the penalty and the company’s hiring practices.

On a Tuesday afternoon in October, Christi Richardson, identified on JK’s website as the manager of the firm’s Alexander City branch, was packing boxes in the office, located in a small house with a red door. She told Reuters she was closing down the office, and declined to comment further. JK’s website is no longer online.

A 4-minute drive away, Reuters visited a ramshackle gray house where the young Guatemalan brothers lived earlier this year. An adult former colleague there said he had been working at the SL plant alongside the boys the day the inspectors came. Wearing a blue, long-sleeve shirt with the JK logo, the man, also Guatemalan, said he no longer worked at SL. The day after the kids were found at the plant, he said, SL managers asked all remaining workers to present legitimate documentation. He didn’t have proper papers, he said, but soon got a job at another automotive plant nearby.

In a statement provided by the same public relations agency, SL told Reuters it had ended its relationship with JK. The staffing agency, it added, provided underage workers without SL’s “knowledge, awareness, or consent.”

Both of the young Guatemalan brothers crossed the southern U.S. border alone last year, said family members and an official familiar with their entry. They are now at a shelter in Kansas operated by the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement, or ORR, according to government documents and interviews with family members. The agency, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, houses unaccompanied children after they have entered the United States. A spokesperson said the agency can’t comment on cases involving migrant minors.

Among the issues state and federal investigators are now probing is whether children who worked among Hyundai suppliers may have gotten there through human trafficking networks, three people familiar with the investigations said. “Minor is part of a child labor trafficking case,” read notes reviewed by Reuters from one of the brothers’ ORR case files.

In the notes, authorities wrote the children described “exploitation from debt bondage (repaying smuggling debts).” They added that an unnamed “third party labor service company” made the youths believe it could have them removed from the United States.

“Some children expressed fear of deportation based on comments made by company officials to them,” the notes said.

    "6" : """Stefanie Lambert was a Detroit defense lawyer working on a succession of routine criminal cases – theft, drug possession and firearms charges. Then Donald Trump’s 2020 election loss transformed her life.

As Trump started falsely alleging voter fraud that November, Lambert began reinventing herself as a key player in his campaign to overturn the election results. She pushed conspiracy theories in court, joined efforts to break into voting machines seeking evidence of fraud and organized a nonprofit that has raised at least a half million dollars to finance election challenges.

Lambert advanced quickly to the vanguard of a campaign by pro-Trump lawyers to perpetuate the election-denial movement through the nation’s courts. That movement endures despite the wholesale rejection of its baseless claims by judges across America, and despite the poor showing in last month’s midterm elections by Trump-backed candidates who embraced his stolen-election falsehoods. In Arizona, election conspiracists Kari Lake and Mark Finchem, who ran as Republicans for governor and secretary of state in the midterms, have claimed they were cheated and challenged their losses in court. Neither Finchem nor Lake responded to requests for comment.

Lambert started in her home state of Michigan, joining four lawsuits on behalf of Trump supporters. They included two within weeks of the 2020 election that challenged Democrat Joe Biden’s victory based on debunked fraud allegations and sought to impound voting machines across Michigan to inspect for evidence.

She has worked with a lawyer pursuing another four lawsuits in Pennsylvania, three targeting state and local officials and one against Dominion Voting Systems, according to court records and Lambert’s social media posts. The suits relied on similarly debunked fraud claims. A Trump spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.

Lambert has also been involved in unauthorized breaches of sensitive election equipment in three states, according to a review of legal filings, police records and people familiar with the matter. Such violations can expose confidential voter information, enable election-tampering by revealing security protocols and raise questions about the vulnerability of voting systems to manipulation.

Michigan’s attorney general accused Lambert in August of engaging in a criminal conspiracy to seize vote tabulators. Lambert denies any wrongdoing and remains defiant.

“I am not intimidated!” Lambert said in a statement posted to social media after being named as a target of the state probe. She called herself “a voice for the American people” in a July 2021 interview with two right-wing websites, the Gateway Pundit and 100 Percent Fed Up.

Lambert, 41, declined requests to be interviewed for this article. In response to detailed written questions from Reuters, a lawyer representing Lambert sent a cease-and-desist letter demanding that the news organization halt publication of this story, saying its inquiries included “fraudulent misrepresentations.”

This account is based on interviews with more than a dozen people who have worked with or know Lambert, as well as hundreds of pages of court documents, previously undisclosed emails from her associates, and police reports related to the alleged conspiracy to access voting equipment and data in Michigan.

The reporting reveals that Lambert, sometimes working with influential Trump allies, played a larger than previously known role as a coordinator and defender of voting-system breaches being investigated as possible violations of state law. It documents how the former prosecutor, facing financial and personal struggles, emerged as a central figure in a movement of lawyers that is sowing distrust in American voting systems and administrators.

Lambert and other election-denying attorneys say they are strengthening American democracy by pointing out its vulnerabilities to fraud or manipulation. Legal experts say they are exploiting the courts to undermine voters’ confidence in election results. Within weeks of the 2020 election, Trump and his allies filed 64 lawsuits in six battleground states seeking to overturn the results. They lost all but one, a procedural victory involving a small number of Pennsylvania ballots that were irrelevant to the outcome of the presidential election. And yet the avalanche of litigation has drawn lawyers such as Lambert, who were inexperienced in voting law, into a potentially lucrative new business of challenging elections and representing those seeking to disrupt them.

Norm Eisen, a longtime election lawyer and former ethics counsel to Democratic President Barack Obama, sees Lambert as part of an ongoing threat to democracy. “She is an important figure in the dangerous election-denial movement,” Eisen said in an interview. “Lambert is still extremely active. The movement is not vanquished.”

Lambert has mostly operated out of the spotlight. She has worked with small-town officials to access the election equipment and data used to advance baseless claims in the media and the courts, according to the attorney general’s investigation and a review of court documents and right-wing websites. While she has aligned herself with Trump-supporting Republicans, Lambert has described her work as nonpartisan and revealed little in public about her political beliefs. Reuters was unable to determine her party affiliation, if she has one.

Michigan’s criminal probe into the alleged roles of Lambert and others in gaining unauthorized access to vote tabulators is ongoing. And last year a federal judge sanctioned and referred her for possible disbarment for joining a lawsuit aimed at reversing Biden’s win in Michigan based on a string of false statements – including that China and Iran accessed voting software to manipulate the results.

David Fink, a lawyer for the City of Detroit, is leading a campaign to sanction and disbar Lambert and eight other attorneys who joined that Michigan lawsuit. Lambert, Fink said, is a leading architect of a strategy that jeopardizes future elections: using courts to promote and lend credibility to bogus voter-fraud claims. He called her the “queen of alternative facts” in an interview.

“Because of the success they have had in creating a false narrative,” Fink said, “election deniers will pursue this strategy again and again, until the courts slap them down and levy appropriate sanctions.” Lambert was struggling financially in the years before she jumped into the election-denial movement, according to a review of court records from her three divorces.

In 2017, she resigned as a prosecutor in Wayne County, where she had been on a solid career path, litigating hundreds of cases, ranging from low-level drug crimes to bank fraud and homicide, according to interviews with four former co-workers in the prosecutor’s office and personnel files obtained in a public records request. She’d been full-time with the office since 2009, two years after graduating as class president from the University of Detroit Mercy School of Law.

By May 2018, Lambert wasn’t working and had “no access to money,” according to court records from the divorce of her third husband, Nicholas Junttila. She was caring for five children, the records show, including three of her own and two from Junttila’s previous marriage. She said she was forced to “borrow money from family and friends for necessities.”

In a December 2018 divorce filing, Lambert accused Junttila of draining her assets, worth more than $200,000, by tapping her retirement account and other methods. In the filings, Junttila said the couple had lived beyond their means, racking up $70,000 in credit card debt.

Junttila did not respond to requests for comment. His divorce lawyer, Connor Ferrick, called Lambert a “predator” in a written response to Reuters, saying she “siphoned and spent every financial benefit possible from her husband” before filing for divorce. Ferrick said Lambert then “feigned herself his victim through whole cloth misrepresentations.”

Neither Lambert nor her attorney responded to a request for comment on Ferrick’s statement.

In June 2019, Lambert set up her own firm, according to a state filing, and started her criminal defense work.

During an April 2020 hearing related to her divorce from Junttila, Lambert broke down while telling the judge she couldn’t afford to replace furniture, clothing and other items she alleged had been removed from her home during the breakup. “I’m sorry for crying,” she said, according to a transcript. Lambert owes her entry into the realm of election-denial to one of Trump’s most outspoken allies: Sidney Powell, a former federal prosecutor and white-collar crime attorney who made headlines seeking to overturn Trump’s loss in the chaotic aftermath of the 2020 election.

As Trump zeroed in on vote-rigging allegations in Michigan, Lambert emailed the White House, according to her July 2021 video interview with two right-wing websites. She attached an affidavit showing evidence of voter fraud, Lambert said, without specifying who alleged what in the document.

The email bounced back, she said. She then reached out to Powell and to Rudy Giuliani, who led Trump’s legal team, and sent them the affidavit. Powell brought her on as a local attorney to handle the appeal of a federal lawsuit filed in November 2020 against Michigan’s governor. The suit sought to overturn Trump’s loss in the battleground state. The suit made a host of fantastical claims. It alleged that corrupt election officials or foreign actors had rigged equipment made by Dominion Voting Systems to produce 289,866 “illegal votes” in Michigan, nearly double Biden’s margin of victory there. It claimed Dominion software had been hacked by “agents acting on behalf of China and Iran.”

Dominion has repeatedly denied its machines were involved in voter fraud.

Giuliani did not respond to requests for comment. Powell declined to comment, saying only that Reuters inquiries were “wrong on so many points,” without detailing any inaccuracies.

“I don’t have time to correct you,” Powell wrote in an email response.

The idea that China hacked America’s election systems was one variation on the “Hammer and Scorecard” conspiracy theory, which posits that votes were manipulated with a supercomputer originally built for U.S. intelligence agencies to spy on foreign adversaries. As previously reported by Reuters, the theory became a central tenet of the rigged-election movement. On Dec. 6, 2020, Lambert filed another federal suit against Michigan officials, also challenging the election results. This time, she sought a court order “to impound all voting machines and software in Michigan for expert inspection.” The suit asserted without evidence that there had been “systematic attempts at mass fraud throughout the State of Michigan and United States of America” involving rigged voting machines.

Lambert’s client was Dar Leaf, sheriff of Michigan’s rural Barry County. Leaf is a leading figure among far-right “constitutional sheriffs,” many of whom have backed Trump’s stolen-election claims. The sheriffs’ movement promotes the fringe legal theory that local sheriffs are more powerful in their jurisdictions than state or federal authorities, even the U.S. president.

The day after Lambert filed the suit, the Republican-appointed federal judge skewered its “speculative leaps” and “hazy and nebulous” allegations. Leaf and Lambert withdrew the suit in February after the judge ordered them to justify their claims.

Lambert’s federal suit with Powell also was fizzling out. They voluntarily withdrew the case on January 14, 2021, after the state and the City of Detroit debunked the litigation’s claims and called for sanctions against Powell, Lambert, and other lawyers for promoting the falsehoods in court. Despite the losses, Lambert’s career was up and running as a legal warrior for the election-denial movement.

Lambert has played a central role in the national effort by a loose network of pro-Trump lawyers and activists to gain unauthorized access to voting systems, according to police and court records of the alleged breaches.

Reuters has documented 26 incidents nationally, half of them in Michigan, in which unauthorized parties are accused of breaching or attempting to breach voting systems, often with the help of sympathetic local officials. Lambert was allegedly involved in seven of those incidents in three states.

In Michigan, starting in early 2021, Lambert helped organize “a coordinated plan to gain access to voting tabulators” in three counties to seek evidence of fraud, according to an investigation by the Michigan State Police and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel.

Nessel, a Democrat, said in a legal filing that Lambert orchestrated the alleged conspiracy with two other Michigan figures in the election-denial movement.

One of them, Matthew DePerno, had led a failed lawsuit challenging the 2020 voting results in Antrim County, where an incorrect election night tally, stemming from a swiftly corrected human error, featured heavily in pro-Trump narratives about vote-rigging. The other was a Republican state lawmaker, Daire Rendon, who has embraced Trump’s stolen-election claims. Rendon has promoted the QAnon conspiracy theory, according to media reports and messages she sent to a township clerk, which Reuters obtained in a public records request.

Rendon and DePerno didn’t comment in response to inquiries about their alleged involvement in voting-system breaches.

Lambert was part of DePerno’s “Antrim election team,” she said at an April 14, 2021, meeting with the commissioners of Michigan’s Cheboygan County, according to a video of the meeting reviewed by Reuters. She was seeking access to the county’s voting equipment, an effort later shut down by the secretary of state.

Ultimately, Lambert and DePerno coordinated the effort to gain illegal access to five vote tabulators in other jurisdictions across Michigan, Nessel’s office alleged. State laws prohibit all but a handful of authorized individuals from handling the machines. One tabulator was taken in the spring of 2021 from a township in rural Barry County, a Trump stronghold where Dar Leaf, one of Lambert’s clients, is sheriff.

The township clerk told state police she gave the tabulator to an outside investigator working with the sheriff’s office so it could be “forensically” examined, according to a state police report reviewed by Reuters. The clerk, according to the report, said the sheriff’s office had asked her to give the machine to the investigator.

The attorney general alleges the tabulator was removed illegally on March 9, 2021, and taken to the Detroit area, where it was examined by computer technicians working with Lambert and DePerno and not returned for three months.

Leaf told Reuters earlier this year that his office was cooperating that spring with an outside investigator who was working with Lambert on an election-fraud probe. But he denies his office was involved in taking the township tabulator.

In August 2022, the attorney general’s office recommended that criminal charges be considered against Lambert, DePerno, Leaf and others the office alleged were involved in the scheme. Nessel asked that a special prosecutor take over the case and handle charging decisions because DePerno had launched a campaign to unseat her as attorney general. DePerno lost in November; the special prosecutor’s investigation continues.

Lambert, Leaf and DePerno have denied wrongdoing.

At the time the tabulators were breached, DePerno had been eager to get access to voting equipment from around the state to strengthen his case in Antrim, court records show.

A court had allowed DePerno to examine Antrim County’s Dominion voting equipment in response to his lawsuit. In a court filing, DePerno said his team also needed to examine machines in other counties to prove that an algorithm was used statewide to manipulate the results. DePerno’s Antrim suit was later dismissed, in May 2021, a decision affirmed on appeal. As Lambert’s profile in the election-denier movement grew, she helped create an organization called United States Election Investigation and Lawsuits, Inc, according to attorney and accountant Jason Rybak, the entity’s authorized agent and a former law school classmate of Lambert’s.

Rybak told Reuters that Lambert had asked him to handle the paperwork, accounting and other affairs. “Someone donated a half a million dollars” to hire lawyers, he said, declining to elaborate.

United States Election Investigation and Lawsuits, Inc was registered with state authorities as a nonprofit entity at the address of Rybak’s business north of Detroit. It listed assets of $500,000 in cash as of May 2021, according to a corporate filing. Its first and only annual report in August did not disclose any financial information. Nonprofits are exempt from federal taxes.

Rybak promised to provide Reuters with copies of the nonprofit’s annual tax filing. “I know where every last penny is,” he said.

Rybak never shared the documents, however, and didn’t respond to subsequent inquiries. His accounting firm partner, Richard Lehr, said in a later interview that the nonprofit was now “for profit.” When pressed on the phone about the apparent change in status, Lehr shouted: “I’m not going to argue with your ass!” and hung up.

Reuters was unable to find any documentation filed with the state to corroborate a change in status. The Internal Revenue Service said it had no record of a tax-exempt organization with that name.

In media interviews and social media posts, Lambert directed supporters to a website that included highlights of the cases she was pursuing and a solicitation for donations to the organization, according to archived versions of the now-defunct website seen by Reuters. Reuters could not determine whether Lambert was paid by the organization or how much.

DePerno, in a brief interview, told Reuters that Lambert was “raising money through several different organizations and entities,” without naming them. In the spring of 2021, Lambert was entangled in another alleged voting-system breach, this time in Georgia. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation, at the request of the secretary of state, is probing the incident for possible violations of state laws restricting access to voting equipment.

The breach is detailed in documents produced in a civil lawsuit seeking to force Georgia to abandon its electronic touch-screen voting machines. The suit, brought by a group of Georgia voters and the Coalition for Good Governance, cites the breach by Trump allies as an example of why the system is insecure and vulnerable to hacking by partisans.

On April 27, a team of computer experts hired by Powell sent Lambert a package containing a hard drive loaded with data they’d copied from the election system of Coffee County, Georgia, according to emails and a FedEx receipt produced as evidence in the civil lawsuit.

In the days after the 2020 election, Trump’s allies focused on Coffee County, in southeastern Georgia. The politically conservative county offered an attractive spot to gather evidence for the former president’s baseless allegation that voting machines had switched hundreds of thousands of votes nationwide from Trump to Biden. Trump won Coffee County by 40 percentage points. Shortly after the election, the county’s elections supervisor, Misty Hampton, said at a meeting with local officials that voting results from the county’s Dominion machines could be manipulated, according to a video of the meeting reviewed by Reuters. On January 7, 2021, hours after Congress certified Biden’s win, Hampton allowed a team of outside forensic computer experts to access the county’s voting system, according to emails and other documents in the civil lawsuit. The team was paid by Defending the Republic, an organization Powell set up, and invoices for the work were sent directly to Powell, the records show. The computer experts copied the county’s election software, voting data and other materials.

In April, one of Powell’s associates weighed in: Former National Security Agency official Jim Penrose instructed the team’s leader to copy “all the forensics material” from Coffee County and send it to Lambert, according to an email from Penrose referenced in court filings. The information was sent to Lambert on a hard drive, court records show.

A copy of the Coffee County data ended up in the hands of computer analyst Ben Cotton, who had been hired by Lambert, according to an August deposition Cotton provided in the court case. Cotton also worked on a controversial audit, spearheaded by election skeptics, that sought unsuccessfully to identify fraud in the 2020 vote in Maricopa County, Arizona.

“Lambert looks to have been a conduit for getting the software and voting data taken from Coffee County, Georgia, to Ben Cotton and potentially others” in the election-denial movement, said David Cross, the lead attorney for some of the plaintiffs in the Georgia lawsuit that highlighted the voting-system breach.

Cotton and Penrose also were involved in examining breached voting machines in Michigan for DePerno and Lambert, according to the Michigan attorney general investigation.

In the wake of the Coffee County breach, Lambert also provided legal counsel to Hampton, the county elections supervisor, according to emails that Lambert sent in July to lawyers in the Georgia case.

Cotton, Penrose and Hampton didn’t respond to requests for comment. Lambert has continued to take on election-related cases despite the efforts to disbar her and the criminal charges she could face in the Michigan investigation of voting-system breaches.

The day after the 2022 midterm elections, Lambert was in a Pennsylvania courtroom. She was assisting a local attorney representing two Republican commissioners from rural Fulton County who had sued state officials and Dominion, which provided the voting systems used by the county in 2020. In the process, the commissioners were accused of flouting a court order by allowing a forensics company to inspect county voting equipment. The case didn’t go well: On Nov. 18, Commonwealth Court President Judge Renee Cohn Jubelirer recommended civil contempt penalties against the county, finding it had engaged in “vexatious, obdurate, and bad-faith conduct” by allowing the machine inspection.

In August 2021, a federal judge reprimanded Lambert, Powell and seven other lawyers who joined the failed lawsuit seeking to overturn Michigan’s vote after Trump’s 2020 defeat. Calling the suit a “historic and profound abuse of the judicial process,” U.S. District Judge Linda Parker ordered Lambert and the other lawyers to enroll in continuing legal education and pay more than $175,000 to cover defense costs for the state and the City of Detroit, which had requested sanctions in the case.

Parker recommended that Lambert, Powell and the other lawyers be disbarred, a penalty also being sought by Michigan’s governor, attorney general and secretary of state, all Democrats. All the lawyers have appealed the sanctions and are contesting the disbarment efforts.

At a Dec. 8 hearing on their appeal of the sanctions, Lambert argued that she should be spared punishment because she was acting on the instructions of Powell and another lawyer.

“I was not the director of strategy,” Lambert told judges of the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. “I reviewed pleadings and merely made sure that they complied with law.” In a July 2021 filing to Parker’s court, Lambert had argued that constitutional free-speech shielded attorneys from punishment, referencing Supreme Court cases “too numerous to mention.” When Parker ordered her to name two examples of such cases to support her argument, she submitted a brief without citing a single one, according to a Reuters review of the litigation.

Leslie Levin, a professor at the University of Connecticut School of Law, said Lambert didn’t provide any Supreme Court cases to back up her argument because there are none. She called her claims in the filing “false and misleading.”

“Making a patently false claim in a brief concerning the law is something that lawyers know not to do in any lawsuit,” said Levin, an expert in attorney ethics and regulation. “Especially when her conduct was already under scrutiny and she was responding to a sanctions motion, it was inexplicably bad judgment.”

    "7" : """ Dr. Lee Kaplan took the stage with an urgent message, telling fellow physicians they have a powerful weapon to fight the American obesity crisis: their prescription pads.

Counseling on diet and exercise alone has failed for decades, he told about 400 doctors taking his annual obesity course at a Boston-area hotel. Kaplan, a leading U.S. obesity specialist, urged them to turn to a new generation of weight-loss medicines, including Wegovy from Novo Nordisk, that could help tens of millions of overweight Americans.

Obesity, he said, should be treated as aggressively as other chronic diseases such as high blood pressure or diabetes – with lifelong prescriptions. “We are going to have to use these medications,” he said at the June gathering, “for as long as the body wants to have obesity.”

Kaplan’s solution for America’s weight problem closely tracks Novo Nordisk’s financial ambitions for Wegovy. The Danish drugmaker, long known for diabetes medicines, is transforming itself into the world’s biggest weight-loss company. Novo tells investors its target market is the 764 million people with obesity across the globe. Its most lucrative region is the United States, where more than two-thirds of adults are overweight or have obesity and drugs frequently command the highest prices worldwide. Novo charges U.S. customers $1,300 a month for the weekly injection.

Kaplan, the chief of obesity medicine at Dartmouth College’s medical school, is a powerful standard bearer for Novo’s case. Until last year, the 69-year-old gastroenterologist led the Obesity, Metabolism and Nutrition Institute at Massachusetts General Hospital and taught at Harvard Medical School. He’s also a highly paid messenger: Novo has spent $1.4 million on Kaplan for consulting work and travel between 2013 and 2022, according to a Reuters analysis of federal data. Those payments are part of a campaign to convince U.S. doctors to make Wegovy one of the most widely prescribed drugs in history – and to persuade skeptical insurers to pay for it. Novo spent at least $25.8 million over the past decade on U.S. medical professionals to promote its two obesity drugs, Wegovy and Saxenda, the analysis found.

That total includes only payments that Novo reported it made specifically related to those two drugs; it sometimes paid far more to obesity specialists without naming any drug in the federal data. The money Novo reported paying Kaplan, for instance, included just $262,038 that the company classified as directly related to the two drugs, and $131,624 for an older diabetes medicine with the same active ingredient as Saxenda. Novo paid Kaplan $976,019 more without specifying any drug. Experts who study these industry payments say drugmakers have latitude on how to classify their spending on doctors.

Reuters examined Novo’s payments for speaking, consulting, food and travel, while excluding those for research. The analysis also excluded payments related to Ozempic, a Novo diabetes drug that is also wildly popular for weight loss because it has the same active ingredient as Wegovy. Overall, at least 57 U.S. physicians each accepted at least $100,000 from Novo in payments associated with Wegovy or Saxenda over the period. They were an influential group: Forty-one were obesity specialists who run weight-management clinics, work at academic hospitals, write obesity-treatment guidelines or hold top positions at medical societies, according to a Reuters review of their credentials and publications.

Another speaker at the Cambridge conference was Dr. Donna Ryan, a Louisiana researcher and former president of The Obesity Society, a prominent group of clinicians and researchers. She has accepted more than $1 million from Novo over the last decade, including $600,691 related to Wegovy and Saxenda, the analysis found. Ryan was instrumental in persuading the U.S. Office of Personnel Management to cover Wegovy and similar drugs for millions of federal workers, an agency official told Reuters.

Pharmaceutical company payments to physicians for drug promotion, speeches and consulting are legal and common in the United States. Critics of the practice have long argued it encourages doctors to put corporate interests ahead of patients’ well-being.

Ryan and Kaplan said their work with drugmakers is essential to advancing care for a woefully undertreated chronic disease. The newest drugs are highly effective, they said, and drugmaker money does not compromise their medical advice.

“I don’t kowtow to the companies,” Kaplan said. “If I can’t defend what I’m doing as being both appropriate and ethical, then I shouldn’t be doing it.” In a statement to Reuters, Novo said its work with medical professionals goes beyond drug marketing. “To prevent and defeat a serious chronic condition like obesity, we need to do more than supply the right medicine,” Novo said. “This is why we work with medical professionals, institutions and other experts to conduct research and educate and raise awareness about obesity, a condition that has long been underrecognized and misunderstood.”

Kaplan, Ryan and other Novo-financed colleagues have pushed for urgent prescribing of Wegovy and similar medicines to a large proportion of patients with obesity and for comprehensive coverage by government and private insurers. The company and some of its paid experts have called denying coverage tantamount to discrimination against people with obesity, rooted in the faulty notion that they are to blame for their condition.

The need for mass prescriptions and expansive coverage of these drugs remains a subject of fierce debate. Reuters interviewed 10 clinicians or researchers with obesity expertise who questioned the wisdom of dispensing these drugs so broadly, especially to the many overweight people without other weight-related conditions. They argue the medicines have serious side effects and require more study, and that wide adoption of such expensive drugs would impose crippling costs on the U.S. healthcare system.

Wegovy and similar drugs can cause severe nausea, muscle loss and the potential for intestinal blockages. They are being scrutinized by U.S. and European regulators over a possible link to suicidal thoughts. Some doctors warn that overprescribing these powerful drugs unnecessarily exposes patients to unknown risks that may take years to uncover.

Some specialists advise a more cautious approach, prescribing the drugs first to patients with severe obesity or serious weight-related conditions. The United Kingdom’s National Health Service has adopted that strategy in limiting eligibility. For these patients, the potential benefits outweigh the drugs’ risks and staggering costs, said Dr. Robert Lustig, a professor emeritus of pediatrics and endocrinology at the University of California at San Francisco.

“I’m not against the drugs; what I am against is the indiscriminate use of the drugs for everyone,” said Lustig, who has studied obesity for decades. “But that’s what the drug company wants, because that’s where the money is.” The excitement around these drugs, collectively known as GLP-1 receptor agonists, is understandable amid soaring global obesity rates.

Originally developed for diabetes, the medicines mimic a natural hormone that slows digestion and makes patients feel more full after eating. Novo is the first company to win approval to market GLP-1 drugs for weight loss. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Saxenda for that purpose in 2014 and Wegovy in 2021.

Wegovy, in conjunction with diet and exercise, helped people lose an average of 15% of their body weight in clinical trials. That’s far more than with previous drugs, including Saxenda, another injection with a different active ingredient, liraglutide. Novo also touts trial findings showing a 20% lower incidence of heart attack, stroke or death from heart disease among patients taking Wegovy compared to a placebo.

Such results have sparked a rush on Wegovy and Ozempic. Both drugs are in short supply. The booming sales have made Novo Europe’s most valuable company, worth about 420 billion euros ($457 billion). Novo said less than 1 million U.S. patients were taking Wegovy as of early November, a number constrained by shortages, spotty insurance coverage and the fact that many people seeking weight loss take Ozempic, which has seen monthly prescriptions rise sharply in the past two years. Others take cheaper knock-offs.

Still, these drugs are a hard sell to many insurers, employers and government agencies. They’re reluctant to pay Novo’s steep price for a drug the company insists should be taken indefinitely. Novo’s trials showed patients who quit usually regained most of the weight.

That’s where Kaplan and other Novo-financed doctors play a role. The Reuters analysis provides unique insight into Novo’s campaign to recruit many of the country’s leading obesity specialists over a decade. Their advice, in training courses, medical conferences and publications, shapes how thousands of physicians treat patients nationwide.

Doctors often take Kaplan’s course, which lasts a few days, to satisfy continuing-education requirements or to prepare for certification in obesity medicine. Novo contributed $10,000 for Kaplan’s course this year.

Wegovy’s U.S. prescribing label, approved by regulators, recommends the drug for anyone with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher, the threshold for obesity. The recommendation also extends to patients with a 27 BMI and at least one weight-related medical condition. In all, that would cover about 46% of American adults — about 120 million people. One of the doctors accepting Novo money — Dr. Ania Jastreboff of Yale University’s Center for Weight Management — bemoaned the small proportion of overweight Americans taking weight-loss drugs compared to the 46% of eligible adults. She cited a study from 2016, before the latest wave of blockbuster GLP-1 drugs, that found just 2% of that group took weight-loss medicines.

“That is abysmal,” Jastreboff told doctors at the June conference. “Is it OK to treat 2% of people with heart disease, or 2% of people with cancer or 2% of people with HIV or any other disease?”

Since 2017, Novo has highlighted that same 2% figure to Wall Street analysts to illustrate untapped demand.

Jastreboff did not respond to requests for comment. In all, she has accepted nearly $130,000 in consulting fees and other payments from Novo since 2014. At the conference, she emphasized keeping patients on medication long-term to prevent them from regaining weight. "Obesity is a chronic disease,” Jastreboff said. “That necessitates lifelong treatment."

Jastreboff has also worked on clinical trials of obesity drugs for Eli Lilly, which markets a Wegovy competitor. Lilly’s Zepbound, another GLP-1 drug, was approved in November for weight loss and has the same active ingredient as Lilly’s Mounjaro, a diabetes drug also commonly used for weight loss.

In a statement to Reuters, Lilly did not directly address the debate over how widely GLP-1 drugs should be prescribed and their high costs. The extent of Lilly’s payments to doctors to promote Zepbound are not yet clear in federal data because the drug is so new. Lilly said it works with doctors and other health providers on research, drug development and education because “obesity is a serious disease that is often misdiagnosed and mistreated due to misinformation and stigma.”

“We are proud of this work,” Lilly said, “and committed to transparency about it to maintain the trust of those using our medicines.”

Some obesity researchers say Novo’s paid experts go too far in calling for wide adoption. An estimated 40% of adults with obesity are “metabolically healthy,” according to a 2021 paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which echoed the findings of some other recent studies. That means millions of patients might carry extra pounds without extra risk of serious conditions.

“There’s growing evidence that suggests a number on the scale doesn’t lead to poor metabolic health,” said Dr. Ayana April-Sanders, an epidemiologist at Rutgers University’s School of Public Health, who wrote a commentary published alongside the 2021 paper. Reuters examined data from the federal Open Payments database, created more than a decade ago by the Affordable Care Act. Pharmaceutical and medical-device firms are required to report payments to doctors, other medical professionals and teaching hospitals for consulting, speaking, research, travel or meals. The intent of the reporting requirement was to shed light on these financial relationships and to help prevent conflicts of interest that can contribute to unnecessary care and costs.

The increased transparency hasn’t stemmed the flow of industry money. Companies’ annual payments have surged from $6.5 billion in 2014, the first full year data were collected, to $12.6 billion last year.

Some doctors said Novo’s payments exemplify how the flood of industry money can dominate decision-making about care and coverage.

Dr. Arthur Kellermann, a health administrator and former dean of the Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences, the U.S. military’s medical school, reviewed Reuters’ findings on Novo’s spending. The company’s large-scale payments to doctors, he said, illustrate a longstanding problem in the drug industry.

“The pharmaceutical industry still sees value in paying medical thought leaders to promote their products, and too many of them are happy to sign up for a six- or seven-figure check,” he said, calling such lavish payments “morally and ethically way over the line.”

“As sales grow, Medicare and the insurance industry come under intense pressure to pay for these hugely expensive drugs,” Kellermann said. “The end result is that everybody's healthcare costs go up.”

Kaplan, Ryan and other Novo-financed obesity experts dismissed any suggestion that they are pharmaceutical-company mouthpieces.

Kaplan said he accepts money from numerous companies and that he’s not beholden to any one drugmaker. Reuters found that Novo accounted for 64% of the $2.1 million he received overall from medical companies since 2013. Kaplan said that’s because Novo has been one of the few large drugmakers working in obesity for years.

He said some of the money paid expenses for a half-dozen obesity courses Kaplan provided for hundreds of Novo employees. “There is so much need for better education and what I like to call ‘obesity literacy,’” said Kaplan.

Ryan makes no apologies for taking industry money. She said the gravity of the obesity epidemic demands that doctors work closely with companies to help spur medical advances and expand treatment. “Being a purist isn’t helping anyone,” she said in an interview. “I'm proud of the work I've done on behalf of patients with obesity.” Novo’s money has flowed to doctors and researchers with broad influence over how weight-loss drugs are dispensed and covered.

Reuters examined Novo’s spending among experts involved in crafting five prominent sets of obesity-treatment guidelines for doctors. Among the 109 authors and reviewers credited in the guidelines, 53 had accepted cash or in-kind payments between 2013 and 2022 from companies that were selling or developing obesity drugs.

Novo accounted for $8 million of the $12.4 million spent on these authors and reviewers, not including payments related to research, the Reuters analysis found.

One of these doctors, Dr. Jamy Ard of Wake Forest University, is the incoming president of The Obesity Society. In that role, he will oversee the group’s effort to write new “standards of care,” which primary-care doctors often use as a quick-reference guide, with advice on Wegovy and similar therapies.

Ard, co-director of the Wake Forest Baptist Health Weight Management Center, said the new standards should also inform coverage decisions by insurers and policymakers. Ard told Reuters he believes the standards should emphasize that the medicines are a long-term treatment.

Ard has accepted more than $200,000 from Novo, the Reuters analysis found. He said The Obesity Society will disclose and manage any conflicts of interest among experts working on the standards, but that such conflicts are hard to avoid in the relatively small obesity field.

Ryan, the former Obesity Society president, helped run the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, for more than two decades. She has also conducted diabetes and obesity research for the U.S. National Institutes of Health and co-chaired an NIH panel that wrote guidelines for treating overweight adults.

Ryan was among the experts the U.S. Office of Personnel Management consulted on whether to change its obesity coverage for millions of federal employees, said the agency’s chief pharmacy officer, Dele Solaru.

“She was one of the experts that we reached out to when we were doing our background study,” Solaru told Reuters. “She is very well regarded.” Ryan was eager to expand coverage for federal workers to include GLP-1 drugs because it could influence other major employers to follow suit, she said at the Cambridge conference. She shared research on the merits of obesity treatment and connected government officials with two key groups with drugmaker ties: the Obesity Action Coalition, a nonprofit advocacy group, and the STOP Obesity Alliance at George Washington University.

Novo, Eli Lilly and other drugmakers are corporate members of the alliance, donating at least $25,000 annually. Novo gave an additional $200,000 for research in 2021, the organization said.

STOP’s medical director is Dr. Scott Kahan, who spoke at Kaplan’s obesity course and plans to assist Ard on The Obesity Society’s updated guidelines. Kahan has accepted more than $300,000 from Novo in the past decade, the Reuters analysis found. He said he has sought to “minimize conflicts of interest.”

The Obesity Action Coalition also relies on funding from Novo, which is the organization’s top corporate donor at more than $500,000 annually, according to the group.

Ryan’s advocacy paid off. Government pharmacy officer Solaru said her agency concluded that the new obesity drugs could be cost-effective by preventing other weight-related diseases and boosting workplace productivity. In January, the personnel office told its health plans they must cover at least one GLP-1 obesity drug for 8 million workers, retirees and family members. The agency hasn’t provided cost projections.

The Obesity Action Coalition celebrated the federal decision as one of its top “advocacy successes.” A coalition spokesperson declined to comment further. Christine Gallagher, research project director at the STOP Obesity Alliance, said her group cites the federal-workers coverage policy “as an example to help influence other decision makers.”

The Office of Personnel Management said agency officials were aware that Ryan had worked with drug companies, which she discloses in research papers and elsewhere, but officials did not know she had accepted more than $1 million from Novo over the past decade. The agency said it based its decision on an objective review of research papers, clinical guidelines and trial results. Wegovy has been life-changing for some patients. Rebekah Carl, 47, of New Columbia, Pennsylvania, called Wegovy a “godsend” after losing about 90 pounds since October 2021. She now weighs less than 140 pounds.

Carl said at first she had severe nausea, but managed it with another medication. As her weight came down, so did her blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol. Her chronic knee pain eased. “It really does affect everything,” she said. “The weight melted off. It’s so much easier to be active.”

Her insurance just agreed to cover Wegovy for another year, easing her worries about being cut off because of its cost, which she can’t afford to pay herself. “I’m absolutely relieved,” she said.

Some patients have not experienced the same success. Jen Wexler, a 31-year-old graphic designer in Florida, is about five feet tall and weighed 154 pounds when she started the drug in late 2021. She lost about 25 pounds in six months, but constant nausea and fatigue made exercise difficult. She didn’t like how she felt or looked; her face looked gaunt, older.

Wexler has regained 15 pounds since stopping Wegovy but feels healthier. She now focuses on eating well and exercising, including weight-lifting. “I’m more muscular,” she said. “I feel so much better.” Many others have also tried and quit GLP-1 drugs for weight loss. Reuters reported in July that only a third of patients who started Wegovy, Ozempic or similar drugs for weight loss were still taking it a year later, according to a 2021 analysis of U.S. pharmacy claims. The study did not explore why people quit, but health experts cite side effects, shortages, high insurance co-pays and deductibles, or a failure to lose weight.

More health concerns are emerging as tens of thousands of new patients try these drugs each week.

Some patients have suffered rare side effects, such as stomach paralysis and intestinal blockage, from taking medicines containing semaglutide, the active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic, according to research published in October. In a statement to Reuters, Novo said the study had limitations and only reflected data collected up to 2020, the year before U.S. regulators approved Wegovy.

In June, the American Society of Anesthesiologists warned that patients taking GLP-1 drugs were at higher risk of a dangerous complication: aspiration during surgery. The slower digestion from the drugs could make patients more likely to regurgitate under anesthesia, the society said. Novo said its clinical-trial and post-marketing safety data have not shown a “causal association” between GLP-1 drugs and pulmonary aspiration.

One reason GLP-1 drugs are so effective is because they reach the brain. That may account for their effectiveness in influencing hunger signals, but could also increase risks of neuropsychiatric side effects, medical experts say.

U.S. and European regulators are studying whether GLP-1 drugs can cause suicidal thoughts. Reuters reported in September that at least 265 reports have been filed with the FDA since 2010 describing suicidal ideation or behavior in patients taking these drugs. Thirty-six reports described a death by suicide or suspected suicide. Another concern stems from clinical trial results showing that patients taking Wegovy can lose a significant amount of muscle mass. This can be particularly harmful to older adults by exacerbating an age-related loss of strength or mobility, according to obesity specialists including Lustig, the San Francisco researcher.

“Starvation causes an equal loss of muscle and fat,” he said. “That is what these drugs do.”

Such risks could be managed, doctors say. But some patients are getting these medicines through telehealth companies and other providers with minimal screening and follow-up, according to obesity specialists including Dr. Courtney Younglove, medical director of Heartland Weight Loss clinic in Overland Park, Kansas. Patients on GLP-1 drugs, she said, need guidance on nutrition, strength training and mental health.

“Without a comprehensive lifestyle intervention and proper medical oversight, these drugs have the potential to do significant harm,” Younglove said.

Kaplan said that’s why he offers obesity courses to educate primary-care physicians and other providers. Kaplan acknowledged that unexpected side effects could emerge as many more patients take GLP-1 drugs.

“But the benefit to people with obesity is absolutely enormous,” he said. “I don’t think we should shy away from treatment.” While Novo pushes for big increases in Wegovy prescriptions, it has held firm on the drug’s lofty U.S. price. The company charges American consumers three or four times the price of those in Europe, where national health systems negotiate better drug prices, in contrast to the U.S. free-market approach.

Novo did not directly address the price differences but referred to a previous statement saying it understood many Americans struggled to pay for its medicines and it was “focused on working collaboratively toward sustainable solutions.”

U.S. insurers and pharmacy benefit managers usually get discounts and rebates from drugmakers, but they don’t disclose the amounts. Wegovy’s cost could still wreak havoc on health budgets and premiums, even with a substantial break on its $1,300-a-month list price, according to benefits consultants and health-policy experts.

Vanderbilt University researchers concluded in March that annual spending on Wegovy alone, with an estimated 23% discount, would total $27 billion to treat just 10% of patients with obesity enrolled in Medicare, the federal health program for the elderly. That would equal nearly a fifth of all current Medicare drug spending, after adjusting for rebates and discounts.

Novo has said Medicare should cover obesity medicines like it does for those treating any other serious disease. Failing to do so, it said, would “validate the stigma and bias that obesity patients face.” Some federal officials and researchers question whether Novo’s promised future savings on weight-related disease treatment will ever cover the drug’s costs. Congressional Budget Office director Phillip Swagel challenged Novo’s argument in an Oct. 5 blog post, pointing to research showing federal spending did not decrease for patients who lost significant weight from bariatric surgery, an operation that typically makes the stomach smaller. Wisconsin’s state insurance board in May rejected a proposal, supported by Novo, for government-employee coverage after an analysis found that up to $14 million in annual obesity-drug spending would yield only $2 million in savings if members maintained a lower weight.

Ryan, one of Novo’s highest-paid experts, told doctors at the Cambridge conference that the emergence of such blockbuster drugs has been overwhelmingly positive for patients and investors. She cited a Wall Street firm’s report predicting billions of dollars in future drug sales, and said she was consulting with telehealth companies rushing into the field to focus on weight loss.

“There is nothing wrong with money,” Ryan said. “Look, we give a Nobel prize in economics, right? So money can really help. It can help promote good in the world.” Over the past decade, obesity expert Dr. Donna Ryan traveled the globe, with stops in Paris, Madrid, Vienna and Abu Dhabi, among a dozen international destinations.

Pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk paid for all of it. Ryan took 130 company-funded trips in the United States and internationally from 2013 to 2022. Another obesity specialist, Dr. Ken Fujioka, also took 130 Novo-paid trips during that time, primarily to U.S. destinations.

Ryan and Fujioka are among Novo’s most frequent travelers, according to a Reuters analysis of spending the company reported to the federal Open Payments database, which tracks drugmakers’ payments to doctors.

Overall, Novo paid for at least 3,400 trips by medical professionals tied to Wegovy and Saxenda from 2013 to 2022, the analysis shows. Most of the Novo-funded trips taken by Ryan and Fujioka were also associated with Saxenda or Wegovy, the company’s two drugs approved for weight loss. Drugmakers don’t have to name a specific drug with every payment submitted to the federal database. The data do not include details on travel expenses beyond amounts paid and destinations.

Drugmaker spending on physicians for travel, speeches and consulting is a common but controversial practice in the United States, sparking criticism about conflicts of interest and compromised patient care.

“These highly-paid doctors end up drowning out the voices of people who aren't being flown around to every medical meeting,” said Dr. Adriane Fugh-Berman, a professor of pharmacology and physiology at Georgetown University Medical Center who studies pharmaceutical marketing practices. “As a result, there’s not a lot of resistance to the prevailing industry-funded view.”

Ryan and Fujioka said their travel for Novo enabled them to provide medical advice that’s valuable to patients, physicians and the manufacturer. In a statement, Novo said the doctors it consults provide insights on obesity treatment and raise awareness about the disease. “Responsible engagement between pharmaceutical companies and the medical community is good for patients and advances care and science,” the drugmaker said.

As sales soar for new obesity drugs, including Novo’s Wegovy, there is growing debate on how widely these powerful and expensive medications should be prescribed and for how long. Many leading obesity specialists who accept Novo’s money also advocate for dispensing the medicines to tens of millions of patients, and for broad coverage by government and private insurers. Fujioka is director of the Scripps Clinic Nutrition and Metabolic Research Center in San Diego. At the time he was traveling on Novo’s behalf, Fujioka worked on obesity-treatment guidelines published in 2016 by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology. He’s now a board member at the American Board of Obesity Medicine, which tests and certifies doctors as specialists. Overall, Novo has spent $715,000 on Fujioka for travel, speaking and consulting fees, Reuters found.

In a statement, Fujioka said it was important to travel and speak about his and his colleagues’ research to fellow physicians. “Some of my lectures pertain to a specific product, but others address obesity treatment in general, including the risks, benefits and alternatives to pharmaceutical therapies,” Fujioka said.

Fujioka and his employer, Scripps Clinic Medical Group, said he complies with its policy requiring disclosures of any outside work that might pose a conflict of interest.

Ryan is a former president of the Obesity Society and worked for more than two decades at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Louisiana before retiring in 2012. Since then, she said, she has worked as a consultant to drugmakers, along with other companies and organizations.

Her international trips spanned Europe, the Middle East, South America, Canada and Mexico. Novo paid for Ryan’s travel to Denmark, where the company is based, a dozen times from 2013 to 2022, the federal data show.

Ryan said the Denmark trips involved meetings with Novo executives and fellow experts as part of the company’s global advisory board on obesity. During one trip, about a decade ago, Ryan said she gave a presentation on obesity to the company’s board of directors as Novo began to grow its weight-loss business.

Other recent trips to Europe, she said, were tied to her work as a clinical investigator on Novo’s SELECT trial, which found that Wegovy reduced the incidence of heart attack, stroke or death from heart disease by 20%.

Ryan said that Novo and other companies value her input and that industry-funded trips don’t influence her medical advice. “These companies hire me because I tell them what they need to know, not what they want to hear,” she said. “This is my livelihood. I make money by giving advice and teaching doctors.”

    "8" : """ An Israeli tank crew killed a Reuters journalist and wounded six reporters in Lebanon on Oct. 13 by firing two shells in quick succession from Israel while the journalists were filming cross-border shelling, a Reuters investigation has found.

The two strikes killed Reuters visuals journalist Issam Abdallah, 37, and severely wounded Agence France-Presse (AFP) photographer Christina Assi, 28, just over a kilometre from the Israeli border near the Lebanese village of Alma al-Chaab.

Reuters spoke to more than 30 government and security officials, military experts, forensic investigators, lawyers, medics and witnesses to piece together a detailed account of the incident. The news agency reviewed hours of video footage from eight media outlets in the area at the time and hundreds of photos from before and after the attack, including high-resolution satellite images.

As part of its investigation, Reuters also gathered and obtained evidence from the scene including shrapnel on the ground and embedded in a Reuters car, three flak jackets, a camera, tripod and a large piece of metal. The Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), an independent research institute that tests and analyses munitions and weapons for clients such as the Dutch defence ministry, examined the material for Reuters at its laboratories in The Hague.

TNO’s key findings were that the large piece of metal was the tail fin of a 120 mm tank round fired by a smoothbore tank gun positioned 1.34 km away from the reporters, across the Lebanese border.

Reuters presented the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) with its findings that the tank rounds were fired from within Israel and posed additional detailed questions, including whether Israeli troops knew they were firing upon journalists.

Lieutenant Colonel Richard Hecht, the IDF’s international spokesman, said: “We don’t target journalists.” He did not provide further comment.

The group of seven reporters from AFP, Al Jazeera and Reuters were all wearing blue flak jackets and helmets, most with “PRESS” written on them in white letters. There were journalists from at least another seven media outlets in and around Alma al-Chaab that day.

“The evidence we now have, and have published today, shows that an Israeli tank crew killed our colleague Issam Abdallah,” Reuters Editor-in-Chief Alessandra Galloni said.

“We condemn Issam’s killing. We call on Israel to explain how this could have happened and to hold to account those responsible for his death and the wounding of Christina Assi of the AFP, our colleagues Thaier Al-Sudani and Maher Nazeh, and the three other journalists,” she said. “Issam was a brilliant and passionate journalist, who was much loved at Reuters.” AFP said the evidence assembled by Reuters confirmed its own analysis of the incident.

“It is absolutely essential that Israel provides a clear explanation for what happened. The targeting of a group of journalists who were clearly identified as media is both inexplicable and unacceptable,” said AFP Global News Director Phil Chetwynd.

Al Jazeera's manager of international communications, Ihtisham Hibatullah, said: "The Reuters investigation into the October 13 attack underscores Israel's alarming pattern of deliberately targeting journalists in an attempt to silence the messenger.”

International humanitarian law bars attacks on journalists as those in the news media have the full scope of protection granted to civilians and cannot be considered military targets.

In the days after the attack, Israel’s military said it was reviewing what had happened, but it has not made any findings public.

International criminal law expert Carolyn Edgerton, who has worked on war crimes cases in the Balkans, said filming Israeli tank positions at the border might have been considered a threat to the Israeli military, if that information was seen to “be of targeting value to forces in Lebanon”.

But she said in written responses to Reuters questions that two back-to-back rounds fired at a group of clearly identified journalists “is a clear violation of international humanitarian law and may also amount to the war crime of attacking civilians”.

Directly targeting civilians or civilian objects is strictly forbidden under the laws of armed conflict, such as the 1949 Geneva Conventions, which have been ratified by all U.N. member states. Neither Israel nor Lebanon are signatories to the International Criminal Court, whose 124 member states accept its jurisdiction in the prosecution of war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The attack was the first of two deadly strikes in the space of six weeks on reporters in Lebanon covering clashes between the Israeli military and Iranian-backed Hezbollah militants along the border in the wake of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas.

Two journalists from Lebanese broadcaster Al Mayadeen were killed by a strike on Nov. 21 as they filmed near the border with Israel. Al Mayadeen blamed the IDF for their deaths. The Israeli military said in a statement it was a dangerous area to be in because of “active hostilities”.

Since the Gaza war started, Israeli forces and Hezbollah have traded fire on an almost daily basis across the border - known as the U.N. Blue Line, because it was demarcated to mark the point to where Israeli forces withdrew from southern Lebanon in 2000.

On Oct. 13, reports of armed fighters attempting to infiltrate into Israel from Lebanon and subsequent cross-border shelling drew reporters from at least 10 Lebanese and foreign news organisations - including Italian broadcaster Rai, German daily Die Welt and the Associated Press - to the area in and around Alma al-Chaab.

A Reuters team of three drove with two colleagues from AFP to a spot to the east of the village where Al Jazeera had been broadcasting a live feed of the border earlier that day. Once set up, Reuters started feeding live footage to its TV clients around the world at 5.16 p.m. (1516 GMT), the sound of occasional shelling punctuating the steady shot of smoke rising from behind a wooded ridge to the south.

After filming for 45 minutes, amid the incessant buzz of drones overhead and an Israeli helicopter patrolling high in the sky, the Reuters team turned the camera to focus on an Israeli military outpost just over two kilometres away at Hanita and filmed a tank firing a shell from there into southern Lebanon. The AFP and Al Jazeera teams were also broadcasting live and moved their cameras at the same time to show the Israeli outpost at Hanita as well.

Less than 90 seconds later, the first of two tank rounds fired from a different outpost smashed into Abdallah and the low wall he was leaning on, killing him instantly and knocking out the Reuters live feed. The tripods holding the AFP and Al Jazeera cameras were a few metres further away and carried on broadcasting, capturing clouds of dust rising behind them and the cries of AFP’s Assi who had been hit in the legs by shrapnel.

Thirty seven seconds later, a second shell smashed into Al Jazeera’s car, setting it ablaze, knocked out the AFP feed and toppled Al Jazeera’s camera - leaving it filming clouds high in the sky above and capturing the curses and screams of the wounded journalists. “Why were we hit? Why didn’t they fire a warning shot? If you don’t want us to take pictures, fire a warning shot. Why suddenly hit us without a prior warning, and then try to finish us off with the second strike?” said Reuters journalist Al-Sudani, 47, a photographer based in Baghdad. The conclusions reached by the TNO scientists relied heavily on three crucial pieces of evidence: the aluminium tail fin from the tank round obtained by Reuters; previously unpublished video provided by Italian broadcaster Rai that showed the launch point of the second strike as well as the tank round in flight; and the audio of the firing and the impact of both rounds taken from Al Jazeera’s live feed.

Photographs and video taken by Al-Sudani and Reuters cameraman Nazeh in the minutes after the attack show the tail fin on the ground near Abdallah’s body in a field behind the low wall hit by the first round.

TNO said an Oct. 12 satellite image and a photo taken by Abdallah shortly before the attack show no signs of earlier ammunition strikes, such as cratering, debris or burn marks, so it determined that the tail fin was related to the attack.

Laboratory analysis revealed strontium and magnesium in a small pocket in the tail fin, elements which are typical tracer compounds, TNO said. A tracer is a pyrotechnic charge that burns during a projectile’s flight to show where it is going.

“Based on its features, the large metal piece recovered from the incident scene is identified as a tail fin assembly of a 120 mm tank ammunition round with a tracer that was fired using a 120 mm smoothbore tank gun,” TNO said.

The armoured brigades deployed in northern Israel by the IDF are equipped with Merkava battle tanks which have 120 mm smoothbore guns, said Nick Reynolds, a research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute in London. There is no record of Hezbollah operating tanks with 120 mm weapons, three military experts said. The Lebanese army told Reuters that its largest calibre tank round is 105 mm and that it did not have tanks stationed by the border with Israel.

“I believe that it is in the military strategy of Israel to kill journalists so that they kill the truth,” said Lebanon’s Minister of Information Ziad Makary.

He said following the Reuters investigation, the government was considering presenting a case about Israeli violations, including Abdallah’s killing, in an international tribunal. He did not specify which tribunal but recognised the ICC was not an option as Lebanon was not a signatory.

Makary said the killing of journalists in Gaza and Lebanon was evidence that Israel was deliberately targeting media personnel.

The day after the attack, Lebanon’s security forces said they conducted a technical assessment at the site, which implicated Israel. The Lebanese army and military intelligence did not respond to requests to see the technical assessment. TNO analysed the audio recordings of both strikes from Al Jazeera’s live feed along with the video and audio from the Rai footage to geolocate the firing point of the rounds. Journalists from Rai were filming the cross-border shelling on Oct. 13 from Alma al-Chaab when they heard the first strike and turned their camera towards the sound of the blast.

Their footage shows clouds of dust rising from behind trees where the first round hit - and some smoke to the right from where it was fired.

The camera then captured the second strike, showing the round being fired from the same area where smoke was still hanging in the air, and parts of Al Jazeera’s car being blown high above the trees upon impact. Using the Al Jazeera audio, TNO calculated the interval between the sound of the two strikes and the thud of the muzzle blasts to determine that the firing point was 1,343 metres away from the reporters. It said the sound signatures from the strikes matched, showing they were both tank rounds fired from the same position.

Combining its acoustic analysis with the Rai footage, the location of the Rai camera and the location of the reporters, TNO triangulated the firing point to grid reference 33°05’57.3”N 35°12’44.3”E, with a margin of error of 17 metres.

According to Google Maps, that grid reference is on an earth ramp in a military outpost at Jordeikh within Israeli territory next to the border. Military experts say tanks drive up such ramps to fire and then retreat down the slope for cover. “Through triangulation we were able to determine the firing point which is just behind the U.N. Blue Line,” said Erik Kroon, TNO’s chief investigator for the Oct. 13 incident.

TNO said that, based on the tail fin features and the calculated average projectile velocity of 932 metres per second, the rounds that hit the journalists were two M329 Anti-Personnel/Anti-Material rounds, two M339 High-Explosive rounds, or a combination of both.

Both shells are manufactured by Haifa-based Elbit Systems, which did not respond to requests for comment.

A separate review of photographs of the shell fragments for Reuters by the London-based Center for Information Resilience, an international organisation that investigates potential human rights abuses and war crimes, also concluded that they were from a 120 mm tank round manufactured by Elbit Systems.

TNO said its analysis was done by seven employees in its Energetic Materials Department and reviewed by a senior scientist and a principal scientist.

TNO supplied Reuters with a 10-page summary of its key findings so far and will deliver a final report in early 2024. The reporters were given the green light by Reuters to go to the area outside Alma al-Chaab because prior to Oct. 13, the area had not seen any significant escalation and was not considered high-risk.

“Issam was not in an active combat zone when he was struck. He and his colleagues were alongside journalists from other news outlets, in an area far from active conflict,” Reuters said in a statement.

The Reuters team did not alert the armed actors in that part of Lebanon - the Lebanese army, Hezbollah and U.N. peacekeeping troops - or the Israeli military of its presence, nor had any of the parties requested such notification.

“It is not standard practice to inform armed parties about our reporters’ precise locations. However, the Lebanese army required journalists to seek permission to work in southern Lebanon and so had been advised of the names of our journalists operating in the general area,” the news agency said.

Reuters cameraman Nazeh, 53, who is based in Baghdad, said they chose the location because it was on a hilltop in an open area with no tree cover or other buildings to obscure the reporters from nearby Israeli military outposts.

Nazeh said they felt relatively safe because they were clearly identified as journalists and in plain sight of the Israeli military - on the ground and in the air.

“My assessment is that we were in the safest possible place. We were very comfortable, sitting, filming and laughing and not feeling in danger because we would have never expected that they would hit journalists,” said Nazeh.

AFP video journalist Dylan Collins, 35, who was hit by shrapnel from the second strike, agreed.

“We weren’t hiding under the trees or anything. We were very clearly seven well-marked journalists, in press vests with helmets with a car that has ‘TV’ on it, standing in an open area in the face of an Israeli military site, maybe two kilometres, one and a half away from us to our west and to our east, multiple watchtowers,” said Collins.

“They knew we were there for well over an hour.”

The first person to arrive at the scene after the attack was Ali Ahmed Rabah from Qatari TV channel Al Araby, which had been filming nearby alongside Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation International.

Al Araby filmed the immediate aftermath as the dazed reporters tried to take in what had happened, now fully realising that Assi was very badly hurt, and Abdallah dead.

“We can’t bring Issam back. Issam is gone,” said Nazeh. “But he hears us, he sees us, and he’s waiting for us to do something for him. Nothing material. But to expose who hit him, who killed him, to the world.”

    "9" : """ Early one morning in July of last year, about 30 Paraguayan anti-narcotics officers flew into a vast wooded wilderness known as the Chaco to raid five airplane landing strips used by drug traffickers.

Situated in northern Paraguay, a small, landlocked South American nation, the isolated Chaco has in recent years become a key trans-shipment point for gangs trafficking Andean cocaine to booming European markets.

Of the five landing strips raided on July 6, 2022, four were on land owned by South Korea’s Unification Church, Reuters found by cross-referencing the coordinates of the runways with a map of the church’s Chaco holding.

Rev. Sun Myung Moon, the late self-proclaimed messiah who founded the Unification Church in 1954, became one of Paraguay’s largest private landowners when he bought the Chaco plot nearly 25 years ago as part of a religious and commercial expansion into Latin America. The church, which has often been labeled a cult by critics, is best known for its mass weddings and an opaque international business empire.

Two senior Paraguayan anti-narcotics officers provided Reuters with 11 coordinates of Chaco landing strips allegedly used by drug gangs. By plotting those points on a map of the Moon holding, provided by a church source, Reuters identified at least five different airstrips on the property, including the four involved in the July raid. Authorities found no drugs or planes during the operation and made no arrests. But there were rustic shacks next to the runways with basic provisions, beds and radio equipment, according to two Paraguayan officials present. A few days later, a team with construction equipment and explosives arrived to destroy the runways and render them inoperable, one of the officials said.

Reuters found no evidence the Unification Church or its members were involved in the drug-running targeted by the raids, or that it controls airstrips in the Chaco, an area authorities in Paraguay describe as lawless.

Michelle Byun, the lawyer for The Holy Spirit Association for the Unification Of World Christianity, as the church’s Paraguayan branch is formally known, said in a statement that the church is aware of illegal activity on its land and is cooperating with law enforcement.

“Both the Church, with its headquarters in Korea, and its members advocate for peace,” Byun said. “In no way is the Church involved in illegal acts.”

The Chaco raids point to a serious challenge for authorities combating the surging international cocaine trade. Paraguay has scant oversight of its national airspace and no radar tracking at all in the Chaco, prosecutors say. That allows drug gangs to fly undetected into the sprawling woodland with shipments of Bolivian or Peruvian cocaine. They land their planes on clandestine airstrips, which are often little more than rutted tracks carved out of the forest. The drugs are then smuggled by land or riverboat to Atlantic ports in Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina, before heading east on Europe-bound container ships.

The Unification Church is a major power in this unruly region. Moon, its founder, first visited the Chaco in the 1990s to fish the Paraguay River. In 2000, he bought the roughly 600,000-hectare plot from an Argentine agricultural conglomerate, paying $22 million for an area roughly ten times the size of Manhattan. Moon’s purchase of the secluded and inhospitable Chaco tract confused many in Paraguay.

In his 2009 autobiography, Moon described himself as part of “a global environmental movement to preserve the living creatures” of the Chaco “in the pristine state in which God created them.” He said he hoped to transform the “long-neglected land” into an earthly paradise and a base for his supporters.

But the church quickly ran into problems in the Chaco that continue today.

Ever since Moon’s purchase, residents of a small town inside the holding have fiercely contested the church’s ownership. After Moon’s death in 2012, his relatives split the church into three rival sects, two of which are waging a long-running legal battle over who owns the Chaco plot. More recently, drug traffickers have muscled in on the territory.

The July 6 raids were part of a probe into a smuggling gang led by alleged trafficker Miguel Ángel Servín, according to Paraguay’s SENAD anti-narcotics agency and the lead prosecutor in the case.

Servín was arrested in 2021, the year before the raid, on charges of drug trafficking and criminal conspiracy. The investigation began with the 2020 seizure of 3.4 tonnes of cocaine by Belgian police in Antwerp, Europe’s main port of entry for the drug. The cocaine, hidden in a shipment of Chaco-made charcoal, was traced back to Paraguay, according to the indictment seen by Reuters. Servín remains in prison, awaiting trial. Servín’s lawyer, Rodrigo Alvarez, said his client maintains his innocence.

Elva Cáceres, the lead prosecutor in the Servín case, confirmed to Reuters that some of the landing strips raided in July 2022 were located on church land. She said she was not aware of the church or any of its officials being involved in drug trafficking.

Byun, the Unification Church lawyer, provided Reuters with an April 2022 document the church sent to Paraguayan anti-narcotics prosecutors, urging an investigation into potential illicit activity. The document mentioned a May 2021 seizure of 449 kilos of cocaine on its land and also flagged the likely existence of narco runways within its boundaries.

Marco Alcaraz, one of Paraguay’s top anti-narcotics prosecutors until his retirement last week, confirmed he had received the document and passed it on to SENAD for further investigation. One prominent Paraguayan with close ties to the church has been convicted of a drug-related crime: Cynthia Tarrago, a member of Paraguay’s Congress between 2013 and 2018 and the regional president of a church offshoot organization.

In Paraguay, where the Chaco acquisition has long been contentious, the church has cultivated close ties with presidents, politicians and supreme court justices. Some have been granted senior positions in the church or its many offshoot organizations.

Tarrago was one of them. In 2017, she was named president of the South American chapter of the International Association of Parliamentarians for Peace (IAPP). Byun, the church lawyer, was named secretary general. Launched in 2016, the IAPP recruits legislators from around the world who are committed to advancing church goals. In 2020, Tarrago and her husband, Raimundo Va, pleaded guilty to money laundering charges after being caught up in a sting operation by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation. FBI agents impersonating drug traffickers provided the money that Tarrago laundered.

Before her conviction, Tarrago, a former TV personality, had been a rising star of the right-wing Colorado Party that has ruled Paraguay for all but five of the past 75 years. She spoke openly of her ambition to be the nation’s first female president and had just announced her candidacy for mayor of Asunción, the capital, when she was arrested on U.S. soil in late 2019.

Tarrago had begun appearing at important church events in Paraguay by 2016. The following year, she spoke at a global summit in Seoul, according to church promotional materials. In November 2018, she flew into New York City with her husband, Va, for another such event at the Unification Church-owned New Yorker hotel. During their stay, the couple met an undercover FBI agent, who asked them to launder drug money. They said they were game. They also told the agent “how inexpensive cocaine and marijuana are in Paraguay,” and said they “had a network that could import drugs into the United States,” according to the criminal complaint from the U.S. Attorney in New Jersey.

By the time they were arrested on another U.S. trip a year later, the couple had laundered $800,000 of FBI cash with the help of a Paraguayan accomplice, Rodrigo Alvarenga Paredes, who processed the funds through his money-transfer business.

Tarrago and Va were sentenced last year to 33 months in a U.S. prison. Tarrago, who had been imprisoned since her November 2019 arrest, was credited for the time served and released in April 2022. Tarrago and Va could not be reached for comment.

Church lawyer Byun said Tarrago’s role as the IAPP’s South American president was only an “honorary position.” The church stripped her title after the arrest, according to Byun and church documents.

Last November, Alvarenga, Tarrago’s accomplice, was sentenced to two years of U.S. probation for running an unlicensed money transmitting business. Months later, on March 29, he was arrested in Asunción, accused by Brazilian law enforcement of leading an outfit that shipped at least 17 tonnes of cocaine to Europe over two years. He is in jail awaiting extradition to Brazil. Byun said Alvarenga has no links to the church.

Paraguayan investigators believe Alvarenga has ties to Servín, the alleged trafficker suspected of using the runways on church land that were raided in July 2022, a SENAD official told Reuters.

“Alvarenga was a key player in the laundering of cash, and that was the link with Servín,” said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the active probe.

Alvarenga’s lawyer is Rodrigo Álvarez, who also represents Servín. Álvarez denied any nefarious links between his two clients but said they know each other because they are both from Pedro Juan Caballero, a violent, cartel-ridden city on the border with Brazil.

Alvarenga is fighting extradition to Brazil, his lawyer said. A series of bumper Andean coca harvests have changed the nature of Latin American organized crime, exporting violence into once-peaceful nations such as Chile and Ecuador.

Paraguay, a country with a long history of graft, money laundering and contraband smuggling, was until recent years largely unaccustomed to drug violence. But it has seen major incursions from foreign drug cartels including Brazil’s First Capital Command (PCC), South America’s most powerful criminal syndicate. In 2020, 75 PCC members broke out of a Pedro Juan Caballero prison – despite authorities being aware of the planned escape.

High-profile murders have chilled the country. In May last year, assassins on a jet-ski murdered Marcelo Pecci, an influential Paraguayan anti-narcotics prosecutor, as he honeymooned on a Colombian beach. A week later, gunmen killed José Carlos Acevedo, the mayor of Pedro Juan Caballero. “There’s lots of corruption here,” Acevedo told Reuters in a 2020 interview in his city hall office, just yards from where he was later shot dead. “The police are totally rotten.”

Drug money has also corrupted many of Paraguay’s politicians. In the days after the murders of Pecci and Acevedo, the nation’s President, Mario Abdo Benítez, said cartels had co-opted Paraguay’s governing elite, including many within his own political circle, leading to a “complicit silence.”

“Organized crime is so permeated into our society that there’s no way we can guarantee there won’t be violence,” he said.

Abdo’s representatives did not respond to requests for comment.

The vast, isolated Chaco, sandwiched between Bolivia and Brazil, has been critical to Paraguay’s growing role in the global cocaine trade. Narco planes land there so often that locals joke about a night sky lit up like a Christmas tree. Much of the cocaine passing through Paraguay is bound for Europe, which U.S., European and Latin American anti-narcotics officials say has now overtaken the United States to become the world’s top market for the white powder. Cocaine seizures in western and central Europe reached a record 315 tonnes in 2021, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime’s 2023 World Drug Report, compared with over 250 tonnes in the United States. Europe’s record cocaine seizure, more than 23 tonnes discovered in 2021, was traced back to a private river port near Asunción.

James Laverty, who until last year was the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration’s assistant regional director for southern South America, told Reuters the “lawless” Chaco is now one of “the world’s most important staging grounds” for cocaine.

“It definitely plays a global role,” he said. The alleged drug-running on its land isn’t the only trouble the Unification Church has faced in the Chaco.

The church grew quickly after its founding in the 1950s, expanding into the United States in the 1970s amid a wave of alternative religions. Moon and his wife Hak Ja Han Moon – known as the “True Parents of all humanity” – became famous for their mass weddings, in which they would marry thousands of believers, many of whom had just met for the first time. Moon built a global empire, investing in everything from fishing and gun manufacturing to real estate and media. Some businesses failed, but many thrived. He grew rich.

In 1982, he was convicted of U.S. tax fraud for failing to declare $162,000 as personal income. He served about a year in prison. The conviction soured Moon on the United States. In a 1995 speech, he described it as “a nation in decay,” and said he was instead betting on “the glory-filled days of Latin America that lie ahead in the 21st Century.”

In 2000, after snapping up assets in Uruguay and Brazil, Moon purchased the Chaco terrain from Carlos Casado SA, an agricultural giant named after its founder, a 19th-century Spanish-Argentine magnate.

The acquisition handed the church full control of Puerto Casado, a small company town built to house Carlos Casado employees who for decades had toiled in semi-feudal conditions processing tannin from the Chaco’s native quebracho trees.

Overnight, everything in Puerto Casado – its houses, roads and cemetery – all belonged to Moon and his church. Anger quickly mounted as the town’s 6,000-odd inhabitants realized the homes they had lived in their entire lives, but never owned, now belonged to a self-proclaimed messiah from Korea.

When church executives flew in to close the deal, locals formed a human chain to block their plane from leaving, forcing them to sleep the night in the aircraft. Early church gestures to assuage tensions, such as an offer to hand back control of the cemetery to the town’s inhabitants, only caused greater outrage.

Its administrators also stoked resentment. Locals recalled one church official, Lorenzo Myung, who would walk around town armed with a shotgun. His son, known as Lorenzito, “was even worse ... because he was more aggressive,” menacing locals if they looked him in the eyes, said Martin Rodriguez, an 87-year-old Spanish priest who first arrived in Puerto Casado as a Salesian missionary in 1980. Rodriguez and other locals accused the Myungs of involvement in a 2005 blaze that burned down the local radio station, housed in the town’s Catholic church, which served as the main mouthpiece of opposition to the Korean ownership.

Dora Irrazábal, a prosecutor who led the probe into the blaze, said the townspeople and church management were “at war” when she arrived in Puerto Casado. She said Lorenzo Myung, whom she recalled as an “aggressive” man, accused locals of stealing church property but provided no evidence. Locals, meanwhile, accused Irrazábal of being a church stooge after she flew in on a church plane.

“It was a tense moment,” she said.

Irrazábal said investigators found signs of arson but did not have sufficient evidence to charge anyone. The case remains unsolved. Neither of the Myungs responded to requests for comment sent to their Facebook accounts. Byun, the church lawyer, acknowledged the tensions with locals in Puerto Casado but declined to comment on the Myungs or the fire.

The town’s early squabbles with the church have evolved into a fraught, two-decade land dispute.

In 2005, Paraguay passed a law to expropriate 52,000 hectares of unproductive church land, but the measure was overturned two years later by the Supreme Court. A 2007 law obliged the church to donate nearly 30,000 hectares back to the people of Puerto Casado and the Paraguayan government, but the transfer has yet to take place.

One protester of the church’s ownership of the Chaco terrain is Alberto David Gauto, who is currently in jail as authorities investigate him on accusations of illegally invading and occupying Moon-owned land.

A police intelligence report obtained by Reuters shows Gauto is also suspected of moving cocaine, marijuana and explosives across northern Paraguay, another sign of the growing drug trade on church land.

Gauto, the document says, claimed to a police informant that he had received training from Colombia’s FARC guerrilla force.

Gauto didn’t respond to a Facebook message. His lawyer, Emilio Camacho, also didn’t respond. The church’s problems in the Chaco were symptomatic of broader hurdles it has faced over the last two decades.

In 2009, a dynastic war over the future of the church led Moon’s eldest surviving son, Hyun Jin (Preston) Moon, to form the break-away Global Peace Foundation. Moon had originally named Preston as heir, but that choice was rejected by his mother, Hak Ja Han Moon, and brother Hyung Jin (Sean) Moon, who forced him out. Hak Ja Han then elevated Sean to senior positions, only to later fall out with him, too, according to Massimo Introvigne, director of the Center for Studies on New Religions, in Turin, Italy.

Following the death of his father in 2012, and amid growing tensions with his mother, Sean Moon left the church to form the Pennsylvania-based World Peace and Unification Sanctuary, also known as the Rod of Iron Ministries, a pro-gun sect with an extreme right-wing ideology.

The schisms have impacted operations in Paraguay, where the branch led by Preston Moon has been embroiled in a complex legal battle to wrest full control of the Chaco plot from the church’s Paraguayan chapter, affiliated with his mother. Currently, both branches own separate portions of the property.

Preston Moon declined to comment.

Sean Moon said in a statement that his father meant for him to inherit “his entire foundation, including the Chaco property.”

He said he was unaware of the drug-running in the Chaco but called it one of the many “tragic consequences” of his mother’s “usurpation of the worldwide foundation built by my father.”

Byun, Hak Ja Han Moon’s legal representative in Asunción, said the church had been unfairly “demonized” by local media. But she said it was “undeniable” that the family feud had had “a negative impact” on Rev. Moon’s “futuristic vision” for the Chaco.

“Unfortunately, the internal family crisis between the True Parents and one of the sons, namely Preston, projected a bad image of the church that it has not been able to improve,” Byun said.

While the Moons tussle for control of the Chaco property, drug traffickers increasingly encroach on the territory, according to residents of Puerto Casado.

Virgilio Chamorro, a foreman at the town’s sawmill, said cocaine trafficking in the region was an open secret. Puerto Casado, he said, “has become the heart of it.”

    "10" : """ On a pleasure boat cruising Gulf waters near Dubai’s glittering skyline, a Nigerian woman in a white dress and gold jewelry nodded and swayed as a gathering sang “Happy Birthday” to her.

Videos of Christy Gold’s 45th birthday party were posted in May last year on an Instagram account that showcases her glamorous lifestyle, months after Gold fled Nigeria, where she was facing sex trafficking charges.

Gold – whose name appears in court records as Christiana Jacob Uadiale – was a ringleader in a criminal network that lured African women to Dubai and forced them into prostitution in brothels, backstreets, bars, hotels and dance clubs, according to six Nigerian government anti-trafficking officials, a British human rights activist who has tracked her operation and five women who say they were trafficked and exploited by her.

Three of the women said in interviews that Gold told them that if they didn’t do as they were told, they’d be killed and dumped in the desert. Those who didn’t make enough money for her were taken to a room in an apartment in Dubai, where Gold’s brother starved them, flogged them and shoved hot chili paste into their vaginas, according to three anti-trafficking officials and five women who provided detailed accounts in interviews and court statements.

“They beat the hell out of me,” one of the women said. “The suffering was too much.”

In a statement to the court after she was charged, Gold denied that she and her brother were sex traffickers. “I am not involved in human trafficking and I do not have any girls in Dubai working for me as a prostitute,” she said.

Gold remains a fugitive from justice – part of what anti-trafficking activists and officials say is a thriving underground of suspected Nigerian sex traffickers who have taken refuge in the United Arab Emirates, a Gulf nation known for its wealth, futuristic skyscrapers and what rights groups say is a poor record on protecting foreign workers and basic freedoms. The UAE is a major destination for sex trafficking, where African women are forced into prostitution by illicit networks operating within the country, an investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and Reuters has found.

Emirati authorities do little to protect these women, according to anti-trafficking activists, Nigerian authorities and interviews with trafficked women.

This story is based on interviews with 25 African women, mostly from Nigeria, who described being lured to the UAE by Gold or other alleged traffickers, as well as dozens of interviews with humanitarian workers, investigators, Nigerian government officials and others with knowledge of sex trafficking in the Emirates. Their accounts are corroborated by court records and case files from Nigeria’s anti-human trafficking agency.

Human traffickers keep African women in sexual slavery by playing on their financial desperation and creating webs of manipulation and coercion, the reporting shows. They subject them to threats and violence. They ensnare them in crushing debts, often totaling $10,000 to $15,000 – huge sums for women from poor families. And, in many cases, they exploit traditional African spiritual beliefs to make victims believe that they have no choice but to do what the traffickers tell them.

This article is part of a reporting collaboration led by ICIJ, Trafficking Inc., which is examining sex trafficking and labor trafficking in many parts of the globe. ICIJ’s media partners on the project include Reuters, NBC News, Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism and other news outlets in multiple countries. Gold did not respond to questions for this story. In her statement to the court in Nigeria, Gold said she had helped Nigerian women and men move to the UAE by subletting space to them in an apartment she owned in Dubai.

“I even go as far as advising them like a mother so they too can make it in Dubai,” she said. But she told the court, “I cannot tell what these people did for a living in Dubai.”

In a written reply supplied by the Dubai government’s media affairs office, the emirate’s police agency said claims that Gold had engaged in the sex trafficking of African women in Dubai are “false and have absolutely no basis in fact.” The statement said Gold had “entered and exited Dubai legally and was not implicated in any illegal activities.”

The UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs said any suggestion the UAE “tolerates human trafficking or that it has little regard to the victims of this heinous crime is utterly false.” Such allegations, the ministry said in response to questions, were “baseless and without foundation.”

The ministry said the UAE’s laws on sex trafficking carry heavy fines and prison sentences. A report the ministry shared said the UAE had referred 20 “human trafficking cases” to the courts in 2021, most for “sexual exploitation.”

The UAE has been involved in international police operations against trafficking networks, the ministry said.

Human rights activists and Nigerian authorities say the UAE doesn’t live up to its anti-trafficking commitments.

Fatima Waziri-Azi, director general of Nigeria’s National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking in Persons, said there has been “no cooperation” when NAPTIP has reached out to Emirati authorities for help hunting down traffickers working out of the UAE.

Angus Thomas, a British activist who founded an anti-trafficking education organization based in Ghana, said UAE authorities, including the police, were uncooperative when he urged them to help African women get away from Gold and her associates.

“I wrote, I phoned, I emailed, asking them to help me get the girls, sending addresses of apartments,” he said. “And I heard nothing.” Sex trafficking is one form of human trafficking, which is generally defined as using force, fraud or coercion to induce someone to provide a service.

Most of the 25 women interviewed for this story said they were promised other types of work but were driven into prostitution. Others said they chose to do sex work but were trapped in situations in which they were abused, their earnings were stolen and they were unable to get away.

The UAE made sex trafficking a crime in 2006 and has established an interagency anti-trafficking panel and opened shelters for survivors. The U.S. State Department said in 2022 that the UAE has made “significant efforts” to combat human trafficking but still falls short in key areas – including failing to “consistently screen vulnerable populations for trafficking indicators, which may have penalized some victims for unlawful acts traffickers compelled them to commit, such as immigration or ‘prostitution’ violations.”

The UAE follows Islamic law, yet prostitution and sex trafficking are open secrets. Business cards with photos and WhatsApp numbers for brothels disguised as massage parlors litter many areas of Dubai. Spas, dance clubs and bars are filled with sex workers. A hierarchy based on skin tone plays an important role in the UAE’s sex industry, according to interviews with trafficked women and visits to spots where prostitutes congregate in the UAE. Lighter-skinned women from Europe are generally trafficked into higher-end venues serving wealthier customers. Darker-skinned women are often steered to alleys and street corners, providing sex to low-income migrant workers from South Asia and Africa.

One Nigerian woman described being taken by a trafficker to an open-air brothel in the desert between Dubai and another emirate, Abu Dhabi. She said she and other women would take off their clothes and spread them on the ground, and men would come to have sex with them from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m.

A Nigerian mother in her 20s said a trafficker led her and two other women to a parking lot in Ajman, one of the emirates that make up the UAE, and forced them to have sex with male clients amid vehicles that were being painted and repaired. At the end of the night, she said, the traffickers took all the money, leaving them with nothing to buy food.

After she broke free of the trafficker, the woman said, she slept in the streets and begged for food. She nearly lost her mind, she said, before a nurse from Nigeria rescued her and helped her get home. The UAE's sex industry is shaped by the country's distinctive demography and economy.

Nearly 90% of its population comes from somewhere else – mostly foreign workers employed in construction, hospitality and other industries. Most of them are men and they arrive alone. As a result, 69% of the UAE’s population is male. The government deals with these demographic realities by deploying extensive surveillance in the UAE – and by allowing a bustling sex trade as a way of pacifying male workers, according to two former diplomats who were based in the UAE and monitored sex trafficking. On New Year’s Eve 2019, Thomas, a photographer and anti-trafficking activist, had a one-day layover in the UAE before heading home to London. He was going into a supermarket in Dubai when a 19-year-old Nigerian woman approached him and offered him sex.

He declined, but asked her if she wanted to return to her home country.

She told him, Thomas said, that she and 22 other women were under the control of a trafficker named Christy Gold. Back in London, he sent her money to rent a safe place to stay and then arranged a flight home to Nigeria.

Thomas said he began trying to rescue other women trapped in Dubai. He started a campaign called Send Them Home, raising money to cover victims’ escape and travel costs. Over several months, Thomas said, he helped rescue eight other women who said they’d been held against their will by Gold or other traffickers operating in the UAE. Thomas’ account was confirmed by Nigerian anti-trafficking officials and women who Thomas helped escape from traffickers.

He also shared information that he had gathered about Gold with Nigeria’s anti-trafficking agency NAPTIP, which can arrest and prosecute alleged traffickers. His efforts included tracking Gold’s Instagram account, where she displays hundreds of online posts featuring lion-shaped gold pendants and other jewelry she sells through a gold trading business she runs from Dubai. In a May 2022 email to Waziri-Azi, the Nigerian anti-trafficking agency’s director, Thomas wrote that Gold was “flaunting her wealth built on the backs” of young women “she trafficks to Dubai.”

Little is known about Gold’s background. In her written statement to the Nigerian court, Gold said that she traveled to Dubai in 2009 and after that began shuttling back and forth, buying gold, shoes and handbags in the UAE and selling them in Nigeria.

According to victim statements to the court and interviews, Gold and her associates targeted Nigerian women who were desperate for work and new lives, promising them jobs in hair salons, restaurants and other retail businesses in Dubai. Gold’s associates helped them obtain Nigerian passports and tourist visas to travel to the UAE. Descriptions of her operations come from five women who said they’d been trafficked by Gold. Three gave detailed interviews. Two of the three women interviewed for this story, along with two other women, have submitted witness statements in Gold’s criminal case.

Each of the three women interviewed for this article said she was trafficked after being approached by a recruiter, Mercy Ewere Owuzo, who worked with Gold.

One said she was working in a shop in Nigeria’s largest city, Lagos, in July 2019 when Owuzo told her that she could make much more money as a salesperson in a store in Dubai.

“I didn’t ask any questions because she told me she is trying to help young women and I thought, ‘She is a kind person,’” the woman, 25, recalled.

She said Owuzo paid for her passport, plane ticket and UAE tourist visa.

After arriving in Dubai, she said, she talked by phone to Owuzo, who told her there was no job for her in a store. Instead, she would be going to clubs, restaurants and hotels to sell her body. It was the only way, she said she was told, to pay down the $12,000 debt that she owed Gold for bringing her to the UAE.

The three women said Gold also controlled them by confiscating their passports. Then, they said, she created fake passports that appeared authentic enough to get them through routine police stops or past front desks at hotels – but not enough to get them out of the country.

It’s not clear from witness accounts and court documents whether Gold was the topmost leader of the alleged trafficking network. The three women interviewed for this story said she exercised a substantial level of authority and was deeply engaged in the network’s operations – personally threatening, for example, to leave their corpses in the Arabian Desert if they didn’t comply with her demands.

“Every time we don’t bring money, they would beat us, put pepper in our vagina, pepper in our eyes,” said one of the three women, who said she was working as a hairstylist in Nigeria before Owuzo promised her a better-paying job in Dubai. “Many of us had wounds, but we weren’t taken to hospitals because they don’t want people to know what they were doing to us.” All three of these women spent time in a two-bedroom apartment in Dubai controlled by Gold. At one point, they said, Gold occupied one bedroom, while as many as 18 women were crammed into the other, with most sleeping on blankets on the floor.

It was here, according to interviews and court statements, that women marked for punishment were sent and where Gold’s enforcer – her brother Solomon – sexually assaulted them and beat their malnourished bodies with a hookah hose, broomstick or other implements.

NAPTIP officials said Solomon has not been charged with a crime. Gold said in her court statement that she never ordered Solomon to hurt anyone who stayed in her apartment in Dubai.

“I have never at any time instructed him to beat any of the girls as I have never had cause to beat any of them,” she said.

ICIJ and Reuters were unable to contact Solomon.

Victoria Oburoh, one of NAPTIP’s top prosecutors, confirmed that Gold and Owuzo worked together. In May last year, NAPTIP was able to win a conviction of Owuzo on sex trafficking charges in federal court in the Nigerian state of Delta. Oburoh said that case and the one pending against Gold are “sister cases.”

A lawyer who represented Owuzo during her trial declined to comment.

NAPTIP began an investigation of Gold after one of her alleged victims reported her to the police in Nigeria. Authorities charged Gold with six counts of violating Nigeria’s sex trafficking law.

After a judge released her on bail, she failed to show up for a scheduled court appearance on Nov. 3, 2021. Her lawyer told the judge that Gold had been “found half dead on the bed” and taken to a hospital.

The judge ordered that Gold be taken back into custody. But authorities had no luck tracking her down, NAPTIP officials say.

Christy Gold had disappeared. Loudspeakers announced evening prayers at a mosque in Al Baraha, a working-class neighborhood in Dubai’s populous Deira district, when a reporter visited last August.

Steps away, young women in colorful wigs and low-cut evening dresses lined up in front of shabby buildings for their day’s work: providing sex to men. On the fourth and fifth floors of one building, South Asian men sat in the stairway, scrolling on their phones, sipping beer and waiting for their turns with the sex workers.

All the while police vehicles slowly navigated the district’s narrow alleys – part of the policing and surveillance apparatus that keeps UAE authorities deeply informed about what’s going on in Dubai and other emirates.

One of the sex workers was a young woman who arrived from Ghana in June 2022. She said she was promised a job as a housemaid but found herself doing an entirely different kind of work.

She rolled up her dress to show the bruises that came with the job.

“A few days ago, my eyes were swollen after being hit in the face and slapped when I failed to meet the target,” she said. “It’s my boss who did this to me.”

He told her, she said, that if she wanted to gain her freedom, she had to pay a debt of nearly $10,000.

“Where do I go? What do I do?” she asked, breaking into tears. She said her trafficker, whom she didn’t name, had taken away her phone and passport.

Another way traffickers and their subordinates control African women is by using the power of juju, a traditional African spiritual belief system.

Women targeted for sex trafficking are required to take “juju oaths,” solemn vows to do the bidding of the recruiters who have promised to help them find work abroad. As part of the oath-taking ceremonies, they are told to strip naked, kneel for hours and swallow noxious drinks that can make them dizzy. They’re warned that breaking their vows of obedience could put a curse on them that could cause injury, death, even generational misfortune for their families.

Most of the women interviewed for this story said they had been required to take a juju oath, with some of the ceremonies conducted in Nigeria and others after they arrived in the UAE. Three women said in witness statements in Gold’s criminal case that Gold’s associates required them to do oath-taking ceremonies in Nigeria before they traveled to Dubai.

“She makes us believe she has juju,” one woman who claims she’d been trafficked by Gold said in an interview. “That is, if we run away, we can become mad or die.”

In her statement to the court, Gold denied organizing such ceremonies.

When women brave the threats of real violence and otherworldly consequences to try to escape their traffickers, they say they often get little help from Emirati authorities.

A 25-year-old Ugandan said that after she fled a brothel in the Deira district of Dubai where she was forced to work, she headed to the nearest police station. She said a police officer took her back to the brothel and negotiated with the trafficker to return the passport to her. The officer left without doing anything else, and the trafficker took the passport back again, she said.

She got away for good only after she reached out to Nyondo Rozet, a Ugandan YouTube broadcaster based in the UAE. Rozet posted a video about her plight, which raised the money for a plane ticket home. Rozet, whose videos primarily appeal to the Ugandan community in the UAE, said in an interview that a woman who called her, saying she was the trafficker, offered her money to take the video down. When she refused, Rozet said, other people contacted her to threaten harm if she didn’t delete the video, telling her: “You are not going to survive.”

The Dubai police did not respond to questions about the incident.

A 23-year-old woman from Nigeria’s northeastern farm belt said she thought UAE police would help her after she fled a brothel in Abu Dhabi where she and six other women had been locked in a room filled with steel beds separated by curtains. Every night, she had to have sex with half a dozen men.

She had slipped away when her boss got drunk and left the key in the door. But when she walked into a police station in the Khalidiya area of Abu Dhabi, she said, an officer told her, “Go to where you came from.”

She said she pleaded: “Put me in prison!” But “they turned their back to me. I was crying, but they paid no attention. They said: ‘To Hell with Africa.’”

The police station in Khalidiya did not respond to a request for comment. For years, large numbers of migrants from Nigeria and other African countries have sought jobs and new lives in Europe. Migration routes have changed as European Union members have pushed migrants back to Libya, the main transit point across the Mediterranean Sea. With the way to Europe increasingly blocked, African migrants have turned, in growing numbers, to the UAE and other rich Arab nations.

Oburoh, the NAPTIP prosecutor, said that when trafficking cases have links to Europe, governments there provide information and cooperation that help the agency apprehend and prosecute traffickers. But when it comes to the UAE, official cooperation is nonexistent, Nigerian anti-trafficking investigators said.

At home, NAPTIP operates in an environment where some government officials also have been accused of engaging in human trafficking – and where, NAPTIP officials say, convicted traffickers often avoid jail terms.

The Nigerian government did not respond to a request for comment. In May 2022, a Nigerian court sentenced alleged Gold associate Mercy Owuzo to five years in prison. However, the court allowed her to avoid prison by instead paying a fine of roughly $5,000. The money was distributed as compensation to the victims in her case, according to Oburoh.

As for Christy Gold, she is being tried in absentia while Nigerian authorities continue to ask Dubai to arrest and extradite her, according to NAPTIP legal chief Hassan Tahir.

Gold posted images of herself in Dubai on Instagram as recently as February and March, although it is unclear when those images were captured. Her Instagram account still touts jewelry that she sells to customers of her business, Christy Gold Jewelry Empire Ltd, in Nigeria.

In one video, a purported customer shows off shiny earrings and a thick ring and says: “Christy Gold, Christy Gold… Tested and trusted... Can’t you see how you make me fine?”

    "11" : """ The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin for alleged war crimes involving accusations that Russia has forcibly taken Ukrainian children.

The ICC also issued a warrant for Putin's commissioner for children's rights, Maria Lvova-Belova.

The court said in a news release Friday the two are "allegedly responsible for the war crime of unlawful deportation of population (children) and that of unlawful transfer of population (children) from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation."

The move by The Hague criminal court marked a significant step, requesting the arrest of a sitting world leader, while multiple war crime allegations mount against Russia as its war in Ukraine grinds into its second year. Yet analysts acknowledged the chances of arresting President Putin are slim.In Moscow, officials were quick to note Russia has never signed on as a party to the ICC as they dismissed the charges outright.

"The very question itself is outrageous and unacceptable," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. "Russia, like a number of other states, does not recognize the jurisdiction of this court, and therefore any of its decisions are insignificant for the Russian Federation from a legal viewpoint."

Ukrainian Prosecutor General Andriy Kostin called the court's decision "historic."

However, like Russia and the United States, Ukraine is not a party to the ICC either. Still, Kostin noted that the Ukrainian government has cooperated with the court on criminal investigations in its territory. He said his office handed more than 1,000 pages of documents over to the ICC regarding the alleged forcible deportation of children to Russia.

A report released last month by Yale University researchers and the U.S. State Department accused the Russian government of operating a systematic network of custody centers for thousands of Ukrainian children.

Russian officials have not denied the arrival of Ukrainian children in the country, but have characterized the children's centers as part of a humanitarian program for abandoned, war-traumatized orphans. ICC President Piotr Hofmanski said the judges decided to make these warrants public to try to deter further crimes.

"It is forbidden by international law for occupying powers to transfer civilians from the territories where they live to other territories," he said. "Children enjoy special protection under the Geneva Convention."

Experts appeared surprised by the news.

"I hoped [this would happen], but I didn't know it would be this quick," said Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab that worked on the report about Ukrainian children. "This is a stunning move by the court, which has moved right to the top of the Russian state," said David Bosco, author of Rough Justice: The International Criminal Court in a World of Power Politics.

However, Bosco cautioned, "The arrest warrant won't have immediate implications because no trial can move forward without Putin being in custody and there's no chance of that happening in the near future."

Despite the difficulty of trying Putin, human rights advocates hailed the news as a major step.

"This is a big day for the many victims of crimes committed by Russian forces in Ukraine since 2014," Human Rights Watch said in a statement. "With these arrest warrants, the ICC has made Putin a wanted man and taken its first step to end the impunity that has emboldened perpetrators in Russia's war against Ukraine for far too long."

Amnesty International called on countries to deny safe haven for Putin and Lvova-Belova by arresting them and handing them over to the ICC. The organization also said it expects further arrest warrants for Russian leaders as Ukraine war crimes investigations develop. While Russia has vigorously rejected allegations of war crimes committed by its forces in Ukraine, it has made little secret of relocating Ukrainian children to Russia — presenting it as a noble humanitarian effort.

President Putin hosted Lvova-Belova, the children's rights commissioner, for a meeting at the Kremlin in February in which the two openly discussed Russian adoption programs for Ukrainian children in occupied territories in Ukraine — including Lvova-Belova's new teenage son.

A transcript of the conversation is posted on the Kremlin's website.

"You also adopted a child from Mariupol, is that right?" asked Putin.

"Yes, Vladimir Vladimirovich," Lvova-Belova responded, using the Russian leader's patronymic. "Thanks to you."

It was a remarkable admission: Ukraine halted adoptions after Russia invaded the country, and international children's rights groups say countries have an obligation under international law to prohibit adoptions of Ukrainian children during wartime.

Lvova-Belova noted that if biological relatives are found, her commission would work to return the children to their Ukrainian families, "wherever they are located, in Ukraine or another country."

To which Putin said, "That's absolutely right." Bosco, the international studies expert who wrote about the ICC, said the court's new case raises some uncomfortable questions for the United States, too.

"This is going to be another awkward moment for the United States because of the U.S. position that the ICC should not be able to prosecute nonmember state citizens," Bosco said.

The U.S. government has so far issued a measured response to news of the Putin arrest warrant.

"There is no doubt that Russia is committing war crimes and atrocities in Ukraine, and we have been clear that those responsible must be held accountable," White House National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a statement to NPR. "The ICC prosecutor is an independent actor and makes his own prosecutorial decisions based on the evidence before him. We support accountability for perpetrators of war crimes."

The U.S. has had a complicated, at times hostile relationship with the international court, especially since 2002 when former President George W. Bush unsigned the statute that created it.

In 2020, the Trump administration leveled sanctions against the ICC's chief prosecutor at the time, who was investigating allegations that U.S. troops committed war crimes in Afghanistan.

In the Biden administration, meanwhile, there are reports of an internal dispute: While the Justice and State Departments favor providing information to the international court about Russian atrocities, according to The New York Times, the Pentagon has blocked intelligence sharing with the court over concerns of setting a precedent that could allow for international prosecutions against Americans.

    "12" : """ MEXICO CITY — Mexico's Congress heard testimony from experts who study extraterrestrials on Tuesday.

And the hearing started with a huge surprise.

Jaime Maussan, a self-described ufologist, brought two caskets into the congressional chambers. As Maussan spoke, two men uncovered the caskets, to reveal two bodies. The corpses looked white and like stereotypical depictions of aliens — big head, little body, three fingers. Maussan said they were found in Peru in 2017 and are estimated to be 1,000 years old. One of the bodies had been pregnant, he claimed.

"These are not mummies," he said. "These are complete bodies that have not been manipulated." Speaking under oath, Maussan claimed the bodies were nonhuman.

Maussan and others have presented similar claims about alleged alien remains in the past. Scientists have dismissed them as either ancient Peruvian mummies or manipulated mummies. During Tuesday's hearing, José de Jesús Zalce Benítez, a forensic expert and a military doctor, walked the Congress through scans of the alleged alien bodies.

He claimed the alleged aliens had big brains and big eyes — "which allowed for a wide stereoscopic vision" — and they lacked teeth, so they likely only drank and did not chew.

The hearing also included remarks by Ryan Graves, executive director of the Americans for Safe Aerospace organization. A former Navy fighter pilot, Graves was one of three U.S. veterans who testified in front of a U.S. congressional subcommittee investigating the existence of UFOs in July. Mexico's Congress also was shown videos of Mexican pilots struggling to make sense of fast-moving flying objects before them.

"We are not alone," Maussan claimed.

On Wednesday, the day after the hearing, Graves distanced himself from it.

In a post on X, formerly Twitter, he said he accepted the Mexican Congress' invitation "hoping to keep up the momentum of government interest in pilot experiences" with "unidentified anomalous phenomena" or UAP. "Unfortunately, yesterday's demonstration was a huge step backwards for this issue," he wrote. "My testimony centered on sharing my experience and the UAP reports I hear from commercial and military aircrew through ASA's witness program. I will continue to raise awareness of UAP as an urgent matter of aerospace safety, national security, and science, but I am deeply disappointed by this unsubstantiated stunt."

    "13" : """ No matter who wins, Houston will elect the oldest big-city mayor in the U.S. this weekend, choosing between two candidates who each have been in public office longer than the median age of the residents they will govern.

Voters in Saturday’s runoff between state Sen. John Whitmire, 74, and U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, 73, will choose a new leader who cuts against demographic trends in America’s fourth-largest city. Census figures show Houston is becoming younger, with a median age of around 35 and 25% of the population below 18.

The choices for mayor have frustrated some voters, including younger ones, in the Democratic stronghold at a time when the party is searching for new political stars in Texas who might be able to end 30 years of GOP dominance statewide and as the age of politicians has become an issue nationally. “I think the main issue is identifying with the politician. A lot of young people can’t,” said Julian Meza, a 19-year-old history student at Houston Community College who plans to cast a ballot. He added, “I don’t really want to vote for them, but I have no other choice.” Fellow student Amanda Estela Portillo, a 19-year-old biology major, agreed that she finds it difficult to connect with older candidates.

“It seems like the older generations ... they kind of just like brush it off and are just like, ’You don’t know what you’re talking about kid. You’re too young.’ And I feel like it’s a sense of hopelessness that a lot of us feel,” Portillo said.

Whitmire and Jackson Lee, who emerged from a crowded field of nearly 20 candidates in the Nov. 7 general election, have both touted their decades of experience in political office. But they also say the perspectives of younger voters are important to them and have promised to make young individuals a part of their administration.

On Sunday, Jackson Lee attended an outreach event co-sponsored by Houston-based Rap-A-Lot Records that featured speeches by candidates and musical performances and aimed to encourage voters, including younger ones, to go to the polls. “I want this administration to have people saying, ‘I’m good because the mayor cares about me. I’m good because City Hall is open to me,’” Jackson Lee said onstage alongside local rappers including Lil Bushwick, the son of Bushwick Bill, a founding member of the iconic Houston rap group the Geto Boys.

Whitmire, for his part, has held various campaign events with organizations for young professionals, telling one gathering in August that “the future of Houston needs a voice at City Hall.”

“Why do young people not get involved in city politics? I think a lot of them have given up on the process,” Whitmire said Sunday after a mayoral forum. “I understand their cynicism and their frustration. And that’s what I’m offering, experience of a can-do candidate.”

Von Cannon, 41, who operated a food truck at Sunday’s voter outreach event, said advancing age isn’t necessarily a problem for a candidate but thinks “authenticity is a big thing that younger voters look for.” Ronda Prince, chief of operations at Rap-A-Lot Records, said experience is important “but you just cannot ignore and leave out the concerns, the issues that young people have. If you want to reach young people, talk to young people.”

Getting younger voters to the polls, particularly in local elections, remains a “huge puzzle” in the city and around the country, said Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston.

“Houston is changing. It’s becoming much younger and certainly more Latino, and the demographics in terms of who runs for office and who wins ... doesn’t always reflect those changes,” Rottinghaus said.

An analysis by Rottinghaus suggested that two-thirds of voters in the Nov. 7 election were over the age of 55. The Harris County Clerk’s Office said a review of early voting for the runoff has found an average age of about 62.

Age has been an issue in other political contests — such as next year’s presidential race, which seems likely to pit President Joe Biden, 80, against former President Donald Trump, 77. In Texas’ general election last month, voters rejected a proposed change to the state Constitution that would have raised the mandatory retirement age for judges by four years, to 79. One challenge with reaching out to younger people has been making voting more convenient, according to Rottinghaus.

Officials in Democratic-led Harris County, where Houston is located, expanded access during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 with drive-thru voting and 24-hour polling locations, two initiatives popular with younger voters. But those were later banned by the GOP-led Texas Legislature.

Rottinghaus also said some younger voters might not vote because issues they care about often don’t factor into local elections. While the Houston mayoral race has been dominated by discussion of crime, crumbling infrastructure and potential budget shortfalls, other matters that are important to voters like Meza and Portillo, such as supporting reproductive and immigration rights and the LGBTQ+ community, are largely absent.

Kit Delgado, a 19-year-old art student at Houston Community College, said that while a mayor can’t really impact those issues much, it’s important to younger voters to have someone in office who shares their values.

“If we have a mayor who supports our ideas, maybe we can get a governor who has support of our ideas and then representatives. I think that’s a good reason to start voting locally, like for my age group,” Delgado said.

    "14" : """ Ohioans woke up Thursday in a land of limbo for recreational marijuana use: Adults can now legally grow and possess cannabis at home, but cannot legally buy it.

On Wednesday night, Republican Gov. Mike DeWine urged lawmakers to quickly set parameters for Issue 2, the citizen initiative voters approved in November. While the state Senate pushed through an 11th-hour deal hours before the law took effect, the Ohio House adjourned without taking it up.

Rep. Jamie Callender said there’s “no drop-dead date” for implementing a legal sales scheme, and that growing marijuana at home or allowing possession can proceed according to the voters’ wishes.

He said he wants “to make sure we’re thoughtful, that we’ve had adequate time to look at it and deal with the things that don’t go into effect immediately.”

Rep. Bill Seitz also defended the decision to adjourn without acting on the 160 pages of related legislation now pending in the House. “We’re not going to pass, sight unseen, such a monstrous proposition in 48 hours. That’s nuts,” Seitz said. Lawmakers need time to work through the complexities of setting up cannabis sales, taxation and a regulatory structure, he said. DeWine, however, worried openly about a worst-case scenario developing, saying black market sales could flourish or that fentanyl- or pesticide-laced marijuana products might become more accessible. He called the current state of affairs a “recipe for disaster.”

Lawmakers had four months last year to act. As a citizen-initiated statute, Issue 2 had to be submitted to the Legislature first. After the GOP-controlled Legislature chose to do nothing, the measure was placed on the Nov. 7 ballot and passed with 57% of the vote.

It allows adults 21 and over to buy and possess up to 2.5 ounces of cannabis and to grow up to six plants per individual or 12 plants per household at home. It gave the state nine months to set up a system for legal marijuana purchases, subject to a 10% tax. Sales revenue was to be divided between administrative costs, addiction treatment, municipalities with dispensaries, paying for social equity and jobs programs supporting the cannabis industry itself. With just days left before the law took effect, Senate Republicans proposed a sweeping rewrite of what voters approved, angering the issue’s backers and alarming both parties in the House. It would have outlawed growing at home, cut the allowable amount of pot that can be possessed to 1 ounce and raised taxes on purchases to 15%. It would also eliminate tax revenue funding for social equity programs supporting the marijuana industry and direct most of the tax money raised to a general state government fund.

The compromise negotiated with DeWine and approved 28-2 by the Senate Wednesday would cut the number of household plants allowed to six, retain the higher 15% tax on purchases and reduce the allowable THC levels for cannabis extracts from 90% to 50%. The deal would restore a 2.5 ounce possession limit and allow 35% THC in plants while nixing state control of most of the revenue. Drafters of the legislation garnered Democratic support in part by adding a provision to expunge the criminal records of people convicted of possession up to 2.5 ounces. That measure would also require child-safe packaging and ban ads targeting children — a priority for the governor.

If legislators veer too far from what voters approved, the Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol or other proponents of Issue 2 can always pursue a referendum. That possibility should give lawmakers an incentive to work with proponents of more relaxed marijuana laws, said Steven Steinglass, dean emeritus of the Cleveland State University College of Law and a leading expert on Ohio’s constitution.

He said some of the maneuvering going on now is unprecedented.

“Voters have only approved three initiated statutes in 111 years, and none of the three have been amended, repealed or fiddled with by the General Assembly,”

Senate President Matt Huffman said the Senate compromise respects voters while addressing important concerns. “I’m opposed to (legalization), but it’s the law,” he said. “We don’t want illegal sales — the black market if you will — to get a foothold.”

Meanwhile, there are plenty of aspects of the new Ohio law that can be immediately enforced, said Louis Tobin, executive director of the Ohio Prosecuting Attorneys Association.

“As of Thursday, it’s going to be very difficult to find probable cause and to prosecute people who are carrying around less than 2.5 ounces of marijuana, but prosecutors and law enforcement are still going to be on the lookout,” Tobin said. “People smoking in cars are still breaking the law, people carrying around more than 2.5 ounces are still breaking the law, people engaging in private sales are still breaking the law, people driving under the influence are still breaking the law.”

    "15" : """ For the second day in a row, thousands of angry French farmers have blocked major highways leading in and out of the French capital. They're calling it the "siege" of Paris.

The protests are part of an intensifying standoff between farmers and the French government. Farmers have slapped the government with a long list of grievances, including complaints about low wages and what they deem to be unfair foreign competition and over-regulation.

To put pressure on French authorities, farmers from across the country have surrounded the outskirts of the capital, blocking at least seven highways with dozens of tractors.

"We are prepared to stay as long as we need to," says Florian Portemer, a 33-year-old sugar beet farmer, one of hundreds of protesting farmers who are camping out on the A1 highway, just a few miles north of the Charles de Gaulle airport. So far, the blockages have caused only minor delays. The government warns that a major disruption could leave Paris with only three days' worth of food supplies.

"Our goal isn't to bother or to ruin French people's lives, our goal is to put pressure on the government to rapidly find solutions out of the crisis," says Arnaud Rousseau, president of the Fédération Nationale des Syndicats d'Exploitants, or FNSEA, one of the country's largest farming unions.

But to get the government's attention, farmers argue they may not have a choice. "Our expenses are going up and up," says Portemer. "There's a general feeling of being fed up. A suffocation linked to all these charges and tight standards."

By tight standards, he means France's complicated web of bureaucratic regulations. For example, farmers say they're frustrated with European Union subsidy rules — in particular, a new requirement to leave 4% of farmland fallow.

Others have complained about skyrocketing energy and fertilizer prices.

Then there's what they say is unfair competition from other countries, which have less strict regulations. French farmers argue this puts them at a huge disadvantage, with merchants favoring cheaper imports that aren't subject to the same controls.

Speaking before France's lower house of parliament, the National Assembly, on Tuesday, the newly appointed Prime Minister Gabriel Attal promised the government would implement controls on the amount of foreign produce brought into France and asked the farmers to end their protest.

"We need to listen to the farmers, who are working and are worried about their future and their livelihood," Attal told lawmakers.

The government has also vowed to give farmers emergency funding and to guarantee them a living wage. But this hasn't been enough to convince the farmers to pack up just yet. An opinion poll last week showed 90% of French citizens back their protest, which started in the south of France on Jan. 18. Some of the protesting farmers tell NPR they are barely earning 1,200 euros (about $1,300) a month and are struggling.

But the farmers also say their solidarity has never been stronger. Many have sent up tents, barbecues and portable toilets on the blocked highways as they prepare to dig in for the coming days.

On the A1 highway, farmers convivially gathered over beer, grilled meats and electronic pop music.

"It's a beautiful demonstration," says 50-year-old Pierre de Wilde, a fourth-generation farmer from northern France who is camping out on the highway with his 22-year-old son. He says it's the future of his kids that makes the protests matter. "That's exactly why we're all here...to support the next generation of farmers to come."

    "16" : """ Authorities in Western Australia said Wednesday they had found a tiny capsule containing radioactive material that went missing during transport last month on an Outback highway.

The round, silver capsule — measuring roughly a quarter of an inch in diameter by a third of an inch tall, or the size of the pea — was found south of the mining town of Newman on the Great Northern Highway. It was detected by a search vehicle when specialist equipment picked up radiation emitting from the capsule.

Portable search equipment was then used to locate it about 2 meters (6.5 feet) from the side of the road. The search operation spanned 1,400 kilometers (870 miles) from the Outback to metropolitan Perth and yielded success in just seven days.

"We have essentially found the needle in the haystack," Fire and Emergency Services Commissioner Darren Klemm said in a statement. "When you consider the challenge of finding an object smaller than a 10-cent coin along a 1,400-kilometer stretch of Great Northern Highway, it is a tremendous result."

Prior to its recovery, authorities had said the capsule posed a radioactive substance risk in the regions of Pilbara, Midwest Gascoyne, Goldfields-Midlands and Perth, officials said.

"Exposure to this substance could cause radiation burns or severe illness – if people see the capsule or something that looks similar, stay away from it and keep others away from it too," Dr. Andrew Robertson, Western Australia's chief health officer and radiological council chair, said in a statement.

Inside the capsule is a small amount of radioactive Caesium-137, which is used in mining operations.

Authorities said the capsule can't be used to make a weapon, but it can cause health problems, such as radiation burns to the skin.

According to the state's Department of Fire and Emergency Services, the capsule was packed up on Jan. 10 for transport by road, and the shipment arrived in Perth on Jan. 16. But when the gauge it was part of was unpacked for inspection on Jan. 25, workers discovered that the gauge had broken apart and the capsule was missing.

The capsule belongs to the mining company Rio Tinto, which said in a statement that it was sorry for the alarm caused by the missing piece.

The company said it had hired a third-party contractor to package the device and was working with that company to figure out what went wrong. Rio Tinto said it had also conducted radiological surveys of areas where the device had been as well as roads in and leading away from the Gudai-Darri mine site.

The more than 700-mile route from Perth to Newman then became the subject of a massive search. Officials from Western Australia's government as well as radiation specialists drove slowly up and down the Great Northern Highway on the hunt for the capsule roughly as wide as a pencil eraser.

Authorities warned anyone who might have come across the capsule to stay at least 16 feet away from it and not to touch it but rather to call the fire and emergency services agency.

    "17" : """ China is emerging from nearly three years of self-imposed isolation, which has been a drag on the world's second-largest economy.

Earlier this month, Chinese officials reported 3% economic growth in 2022 — the second-lowest in at least four decades.

But now that stringent COVID-19 lockdowns have been lifted, officials say the country is back in business. Analysts, however, say it won't be easy.

Here is why. China has been trying to woo back foreign investors and businesses after nearly three years of disrupted supply chains, delayed logistics, stringent regulation on sectors ranging from consumer technology to property, and onerous lockdowns that shuttered factories. "More focus will be placed on expanding domestic demand, keeping supply chains stable, supporting the private sector, reforming the state-owned enterprises, attracting foreign investment and preventing economic and financial risks," Liu He, the country's vice premier and one of its top economic policymakers, reassured business elite gathered at Davos in Switzerland earlier this month.

Understandably, some remain skeptical.

"Trust but verify," advises Nargiza Salidjanova, a China director at the research firm Rhodium Group.

She says China-watchers are still waiting to see more substantial pro-business policy changes, such as giving private and foreign firms equal access in technology and certain industrial sectors and reducing tariffs on imported goods.

"It is not enough to talk about these things," she says. "The message and the practice of it has to really align to strongly encourage foreign investors."

Salidjanova points to the official 3% GDP growth figure for 2022, despite repeated lockdowns and supply chain disruptions. "The market didn't believe the numbers. That's not very encouraging. The first step is to actually start releasing accurate numbers so investors can trust you again." Adding to China's challenges are bigger global economic uncertainties — just as China finally reopens its borders. China weathered the pandemic well — at first. "In 2020, China was up and running with manufacturing again. Nobody else was. So exports really drove the recovery in China, the first recovery in China," says Bert Hofman, a professor at the National University of Singapore and a former China director for the World Bank.

But 2023 is different, says Hofman. "The world economy is not doing so well and therefore export demand will be lackluster at best," he says.

In the U.S., for example, central bankers are working to put off a recession and cool high inflation.

So, given a weaker global economic outlook, China's recovery will be more reliant on getting its own citizens to spend more.

And that is the tricky bit.

"It really has to come from the consumer in terms of, you know, are people going to be willing to dine out? Are they willing to spend on entertainment and leisure goods? Are they willing to return to China's malls and markets and kind of lend support to the retail environment?" says Nick Marro, a senior analyst with the Economist Intelligence Unit research firm.

Marro believes there will be some pent-up consumer demand as China gets over a massive surge in COVID cases later this year. Chinese consumers plowed their somewhat diminished incomes into savings during the pandemic, and so now they do have a bit more to spend.

However, they're also risk-averse and sensitive to any perception that China could reverse course on public health policy and economic reopening again, Marro says. "We are expecting this consumer recovery to be really drawn out." Of course, COVID-19 still remains a variable. It's a potential X-factor that could continue to jeopardize China's economic recovery, in addition to its public health system.

"Part of the equation for how long that immunity [to the current COVID strain] lasts is how quickly the virus is evolving," says Lauren Ancel Meyers, a professor at the Center for Pandemic Decision Science at the University of Texas. She says: "What is the next variant that's going to emerge and spread over the world? How similar does it look to the current spreading variants and the vaccines that they use to vaccinate people?"

China's public health authorities say 80% of the country — more than 1.1 billion people — has already been infected with COVID in this most recent surge.

Such a rapid and wide-scale level of infection may result in a decent amount of natural immunity. But China's economy is far from being immune to further shocks.

    "18" : """ A Hong Kong court has ordered the liquidation of the Evergrande Group, China's giant and massively indebted real estate developer, after the company was unable to restructure the $300 billion it owed investors.

Just six years ago, Evergrande was riding high, preselling apartments to middle- and upper-income Chinese. In 2018, it was listed as the world's most valuable real estate company. But just three years later, it was on the financial ropes. Massively overleveraged and unable to complete some existing projects, Evergrande has become symbolic of a Chinese economy that faces some major near-term obstacles: slowing growth, increasing debt and a shrinking workforce. Evergrande had been seeking a $23 billion debt restructuring plan, but that fell apart last year when the company's billionaire CEO, Hui Ka Yan, also known as Xu Jiayin — once one of Asia's richest people — came under investigation for unspecified criminal behavior.

China invests roughly 20% to 30% of gross domestic product annually in the economy's property and infrastructure sectors.

Although Evergrande's demise is unlikely to have an immediate impact on U.S. consumers, it is yet another indicator that China's economy — which makes up about 20% of the world's GDP — is undergoing a painful period of slowdown, and that could result in slower global growth down the road.

Here are some things to know: Evergrande's collapse is a big deal, but it's not another Lehman Brothers

Some are already comparing Evergrande's likely demise to the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers, which presaged the Great Recession. The financial giant Lehman filed for bankruptcy on Sept. 15, 2008, with $613 billion in debt, triggering a banking meltdown that sent the already recessionary U.S. economy into a tailspin.

The dramatic fall of Lehman was due in large part to millions of risky mortgages propping up an unstable financial system. Homebuyers with mortgage payments they couldn't afford defaulted on their loans, sending shock waves through Wall Street and leaving those borrowers vulnerable to foreclosure. 

But the experts who spoke with NPR don't think the global economy is exposed to that extent.

Evergrande has been on a slow burn to insolvency since at least 2020, when the Chinese government launched a program, known as the "three red lines," aimed at deleveraging the real estate market. Recognizing that this sector was overheated, Beijing placed restrictions on how much it could borrow.

"It worked," says Dexter Roberts, director of China affairs at the Mansfield Center at the University of Montana. "Evergrande has been the biggest victim of that policy."

But parallels with the collapse of Lehman, which was carrying $613 billion in debt (in 2008 dollars), are "a bit of an overstatement," says Roberts, who is also a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub and the author of The Myth of Chinese Capitalism: The Worker, the Factory, and the Future of the World.

He calls the company's demise "a controlled implosion."

"China has known for a long time that their economy was imbalanced and too reliant on debt, with the real estate sector the most indebted industry of all and Evergrande the poster child for the most indebted company in that sector."

Scott Kennedy, senior adviser and trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, agrees that Evergrande's collapse should come as no surprise to its investors or to the rest of the world.

He says that Evergrande's business model, like that of other real estate developers in China, is pre-sold housing — an inherently risky strategy. It has led hundreds of thousands of Chinese to buy homes that now have no timeline — and perhaps no hope — of ever being completed.

"At some point, you may not be able to actually complete all of that housing. ... Eventually projects get bogged down and your financing situation gets worse," Kennedy says. Many ordinary Chinese are seeing their real estate investments evaporate

Chinese households have 70% or more of their asset wealth in their apartments. Evergrande's collapse, although long anticipated, comes as a blow to some, says Roberts.

Another smaller Chinese property developer, Country Garden, also recently got in trouble.

"They're very worried. They're seeing their one big asset depreciating," he says.

"They own their apartment, and in some cases more than one," he says. "When the property market is doing as badly as it's doing in China ... there's sort of a negative wealth effect for consumers and they don't want to spend."

The drawn-out liquidation of Evergrande means ordinary investors who just wanted to buy an apartment and larger institutional investors "are going to need to stand in line, and the courts are going to have to figure out who is going to be at the head of that line and get paid," Kennedy says. It's unlikely to have much immediate impact on U.S. consumers

Diana Choyleva, a senior fellow on China's economy at the Asia Society, says Evergrande's investors — both foreign and domestic — will see the biggest impact from Monday's ruling in Hong Kong. "This is more of an outside investor focus," she says.

So U.S. consumers are unlikely to see much impact, at least in the short term. The time horizon to wind down Evergrande could take a while too, further mitigating its impact, she says.

While the Evergrande case was brought in Hong Kong because that's where the company's shares are listed, Choyleva says that Guangzhou, where Evergrande is based, "is not one of the three Chinese cities that mutually recognize liquidation orders," she says.

"So the liquidator could find it hard to take control of Evergrande subsidiaries in mainland China," she says. The process of liquidating the company "will be protracted."

Evergrande indicates a broader concern about China's economy that may be far-reaching
Beijing has come to recognize that an export-led economy on the scale that China has built in recent decades cannot go on forever, and it has tried to promote more domestic consumption to take up some of the slack.

However, the implosion of Evergrande could prove a blow to confidence both inside and outside China, Kennedy says. "There is the confidence about the company itself and the financial problems that it's gotten into and what that means for the real estate sector," he says.

"The next is what is people's confidence in the Chinese government's ability to manage this process in a fair, dispassionate, objective way," he says.

Choyleva and others see the potential for deflation ahead as the Chinese economy struggles with a number of issues going forward. In November, consumer prices in China fell at their fastest rate in three years.

China "should be on American's radar because, first of all, China is a huge economy," she says. "If China is having severe deflation at home, pretty much the only choice left would be [for it] to export deflation."

At first glance, that would seem to benefit consumers buying Chinese-made goods. Instead, it's more likely to mean that U.S.-based competitors will need to lower their prices to compete with a flood of ever-cheaper Chinese products. "That translates into businesses closing, jobs being lost and consumers being worse off," Choyleva says.

Roberts sees similar concerns. The U.S. and China, he says, "are deeply entwined," and most top U.S. multinationals "secure a significant portion of their revenues and profits from the China market or their supply chains start there."

Meanwhile, China is pumping money into manufacturing to try to offset its slowing economy.

"Ultimately, [China] is going to be producing a lot of goods that they need to sell somewhere, and they're going to be selling them on the cheap. So I would imagine [that] could be a deflationary force."

    "19" : """ Peruvian president Dina Boluarte said in a televised address on Saturday that she rejected the "unconstitutional and discriminatory" way an investigation into possible illicit enrichment is being carried out, after police broke down the front door of her house with a battering ram overnight in search of luxury watches.

Police had waited in vain for several minutes for someone to open the door late Friday, as dozens of armed officers carrying ballistic shields and batons looked on. Boluarte said the authorities did not allow enough time for her family members to rouse themselves, dress and answer the door, especially given the late hour.

After their raid around midnight, officers went to the presidential palace where, this time, they were admitted without resorting to force.

The country is accustomed to seeing searches in the homes of former presidents, but this marked the first time in Peru's history that police forcibly entered the home of a sitting president. Raids on the presidential palace had happened before.

Boluarte is being preliminarily investigated for allegedly acquiring an undisclosed collection of luxury watches since becoming vice president and social inclusion minister in July 2021, and then president in December 2022.

The investigation began in mid-March after a TV program spotlighted Boluarte wearing a Rolex watch that is worth up to $14,000 in Peru. Later, other programs detected at least two more Rolexes.

Boluarte, a 61-year-old lawyer, was a modest district official before entering then-President Pedro Castillo's government on a monthly salary of $8,136 in July 2021. Boluarte later assumed the presidency with a lower salary of $4,200 per month. Shortly thereafter, she began to display the luxury watches.

Boluarte did not list any Rolexes in an obligatory asset declaration document.

In her pre-recorded and televised address on Saturday, Boluarte did not clarify the origin of the watches. Boluarte said that her lawyer had advised her not to make any statement until she attends the prosecutor's office to "clarify the facts."

But she denied accusations of corruption. "I have always said that I'm an honest woman," Boluarte said.

"I ask myself a question: since when does a sector of the press care about what a president wears or does not wear? I hope and I want to believe that this is not a sexist or discriminatory issue," added Boluarte, who is Peru's first female president.

Boluarte's lawyer, Mateo Castañeda, told radio station RPP on Saturday morning that police even searched under the carpets at the presidential palace, and found approximately 10 "nice" watches. Castañeda did not say how many of the watches found in the palace were Rolexes.

"Staff from the Government Palace completely facilitated the diligence requested by the Attorney General's Office, which was carried out normally and without incident," Peru's presidency said in a message Saturday morning on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter.

Prime Minister Gustavo Adrianzén told RPP radio that "a storm was being generated where there is none" and the work of the prosecution is causing "political noise that affects investments."

Boluarte initially claimed ownership of at least one Rolex as a long-held possession and urged the media not to delve into personal matters during a press conference in March.

Earlier in the week, Attorney General Juan Villena criticized Boluarte's request to delay her appearance in court for two weeks, emphasizing her obligation to cooperate with the investigation.

Political turmoil is nothing new in Peru, which has seen six presidents in the last six years. But this "latest crisis will further tarnish the image of the Peruvian presidency, with potentially significant political and economic implications," said Benjamin Gedan, the director of the Wilson Center's Latin America Program.

Given the economic struggles of many Peruvians, "allegations of corruption could be incendiary," Gedan added.

Many see Boluarte's recent statements as contradicting her earlier pledge to speak truthfully to prosecutors, exacerbating a political crisis stemming from her unexplained ownership of Rolex watches.

The attorney general emphasized Boluarte's obligation to promptly produce the three Rolex watches for investigation, cautioning against their disposal or destruction.

Boluarte assumed the presidency in December 2022 following Castillo's impeachment after he attempted to dissolve congress and rule by decree. At least 49 people were killed in the protests that followed.

Critics accuse Boluarte's government of taking an increasingly authoritarian bent as it staves off demands for early elections and works with members of congress on laws that threaten to undermine the independence of Peru's judicial system.

Boluarte will testify to the prosecutor's office on April 5, Castañeda told RPP.

Since last year's mobilizations and their deadly consequences, there has not been a strong social movement capable of removing Boluarte, according to political analyst and lawyer Juan de la Puente.

"There is an enormous distrust that their presence on the streets can lead to anything positive," de la Puente said in a telephone interview, referring to potential protesters.

Still, the weekend raids highlight that Boluarte's government has run its course, de la Puente said, adding that defining exactly when she might step down is not yet possible.

    "20" : """ A year ago, Sido Naji woke to his house shaking in northwest Syria. He was used to the sounds of shelling and airstrikes after more than a decade of war, but this time the assailant was a force of nature: a massive earthquake.

The 16-year-old and his father managed to flee before the house collapsed. As they zig-zagged through a crowded street in Jinderis in Aleppo province, a stone wall crashed onto them, crushing the teen’s leg and breaking his arm.

The devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake on Feb. 6, 2023, killed more than 59,000 people in Syria and Turkey. For its survivors in Syria, the massive temblor compounded already rampant poverty, destroyed hospitals and electrical and water systems, and forced many Syrians already displaced by war to move into tented settlements. In Jinderis, as in many of Syria’s earthquake-hit areas, there has been nearly no reconstruction and whole blocks still lie in rubble. Naji, whose leg was amputated, lives in a muddy tent.

“It’s cold at night and there is no lumber (for heating) or anything,” he said.

Syria has been wracked by an uprising-turned-civil war since 2011, and the conflict in the opposition-held northwestern enclave is at its worst in years. Syrian and Russian military shelling and strikes have killed dozens of people and displaced more than 100,000 others there since August.

The earthquake killed at least 6,000 people in Syria, mainly in the northwest, where most of the 4.5 million people rely on humanitarian aid to survive. Some 800,000 people living in tents need to be rehoused. The World Bank estimates the quake caused more than $5 billion in damage across northern Syria.

Nonetheless, an initial outpouring of international assistance quickly subsided. United Nations agencies and other humanitarian organizations have been struggling to fund programs that provide a lifeline in Syria, blaming donor fatigue, the COVID-19 pandemic, and conflicts elsewhere that have erupted in recent years.

The U.N.'s World Food Program, which estimates that over 12 million Syrians lack regular access to food, announced in December that it would stop its main assistance program in Syria in 2024.

Tanya Evans, the International Rescue Committee’s Syria Country Director says needs on both sides of Syria’s frontline have never been higher. “Families are facing rampant inflation coupled with loss of jobs, and having to make heartbreaking decisions about getting food on the table or going hungry,” Evans told The Associated Press.

Yasmine al-Ali at the Salah ad-Din camp in the Idlib countryside shivers as she tries to tie her ragged tent together and digs a ditch in the mud to stop water from flooding her makeshift home.

Patting a drenched mat inside the tent, she says: “Look, it’s just water and mud. … We need new tents.” Yasine al-Ahmad, who manages the camp of more than 500 families, says wood for heating is far too expensive, so most people burn plastic instead, filling the camps with toxic smoke as they do whatever they can to get through the winter. Many have to skip meals due to food insecurity and rationing.

“There’s also been difficulties in supporting water stations, education services, medical support in hospitals,” U.N. Deputy Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Syria Crisis David Carden told the AP during a visit to northwestern Syria in late January. While the needs are growing, he said, “We cannot do more with less.” The U.N. was only able to secure 37% of the $5.3 billion needed for its 2023 humanitarian response in Syria, which Carden said was one of the lowest funding targets since the conflict started.

And with a political solution nowhere in sight, Syria’s conflict has become a major obstacle for humanitarian organizations.

It is “hard to convince donors to build for longer term, for development,” said Rosa Cresanti, the head of the World Health Organization office in Gaziantep, Turkey. “We are still in a humanitarian situation because of the ongoing conflict. This is the main reason why there are no long-term plans.” Ahmed Koteich, a construction worker, said people have stopped waiting for aid and are trying to cobble together whatever resources they can to restore and restock their shops and farms.

“The international community said it stood with the residents, with their thoughts and rhetoric,” Koteich said. “But this talk won’t help the people here.”

    "21" : """Your Google search history for 2023 has arrived.

Well, actually, the world’s. On Monday, the California-based tech giant released its “Year in Search,” a roundup of 2023’s top global queries, ranging from unforgettable pop culture moments (hello, Barbenheimer ), to the loss of beloved figures and tragic news carrying worldwide repercussions.

The ongoing Israel-Hamas war topped news trends in 2023, per Google’s global data, followed by queries related to the Titanic-bound submersible that imploded in June, as well as February’s devastating earthquakes in Turkey and Syria.

Damar Hamlin was Google’s top trending person on search this year. A safety with the NFL’s Buffalo Bills, Hamlin experienced a near-death cardiac arrest on the field during a January game, but has since completed a celebrated comeback. Actor Jeremy Renner, who survived a serious snowplow accident at the start of 2023, followed. Meanwhile, the late Matthew Perry and Tina Turner led search trends among notable individuals who passed away. In the world of entertainment, “Barbie” dominated Google search’s movie trends this year — followed by Barbenheimer co-pilot “Oppenheimer” and Indian thriller “Jawan.” In TV, “The Last of Us,” “Wednesday” and “Ginny and Georgia” were the top three trending shows in 2023.

Yoasobi’s "アイドル (Idol)” was Google’s top trending song on search. Jason Aldean’s “Try That In A Small Town” — which soared in the charts after controversy this summer — and Shakira and Bizarrap’s “Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53” followed.

And that’s just the tip of the iceberg for Google’s 2023 global search trends. Bibimbap was the top trending recipe. Inter Miami CF, the new home of Argentine soccer superstar Lionel Messi, led Google’s sports teams trends. And in the U.S. specifically, many consumers spent 2023 asking why eggs, Taylor Swift tickets and sriracha bottles were so expensive — while “rizz” (recently named Oxford’s word of the year ) was a frontrunner for trending slang definition inquires. You can find more data, including country-specific lists and trends from years past, on Google’s “Year in Search” archive. The company says it collected its 2023 search results from Jan. 1 through Nov. 27 of this year. Google isn’t the only one to publish annual data as 2023 draws to a close — and from dictionary lookups to music streams, chances are, you’ve probably seen other lists recapping online activity this year. Last week, for example, Wikipedia released its year-end list of most-viewed entries — with its article about ChatGPT leading the pack.

To mark the search engine’s 25th birthday, Google also released top search data “of all time” across various specific categories. Since 2004 (when the company’s trends data first became available globally), the most-Googled Grammy winner of all time has been Beyoncé, for example, while Portuguese soccer great Cristiano Ronaldo is the highest-searched athlete, and the most-searched movie or TV cast is “Harry Potter.”

    "22" : """Humanity’s fight to curb climate change is failing in dozens of ways with people getting sicker and dying as the world warms and the fossil fuels causing it get more subsidies, according to two global reports issued Tuesday.

The health journal Lancet’s annual Countdown on climate and health found more people, especially the elderly, dying because of heat waves in recent years and it projects that will soar as temperatures keep rising. The international team of doctors, scientists and economists looked at 47 measurements, many outside health, to diagnose a sick Earth, emphasizing harms they attribute directly to the fossil fuel industry.

Earlier in the day, the World Resources Institute, Climate Action Tracker, the Bezos Earth Fund and others issued their State of Climate Action report, which found the world off track in 41 of 42 important measurements. It said six indicators are heading in the wrong direction, including fossil fuel subsidies. Also Tuesday, the United States government issued its more than 2,200-page National Climate Assessment that looked at hundreds of measurements for what warming is doing to America. Worldwide heat deaths for people over 65 were 85% higher in the last 10 years compared to 1991 to 2000, the study found. Researchers compared the death increase to computer simulations for the same population but in a world that hadn’t warmed and found they could attribute most of those deaths to climate change, not population growth. In the U.S., heat deaths for the elderly increased 88% in the past five years compared to 2000 to 2004 with most of that attributable to climate change, the study found. There were 23,200 elderly heat deaths in 2022, the report found.

“We are already seeing climate change claiming lives and livelihoods in every part of the world,” said Lancet Countdown Executive Director Marina Romanello. “However, these impacts that we’re seeing today could be just an early symptom of a very dangerous future unless we tackle climate change urgently.” Romanello said people self-reporting hunger because of heat waves and drought has also soared, adding “this could be just an early glimpse into what we now know could be a very dangerous future.”

“These findings are stark and — coming from the most thorough annual scientific assessment at the nexus of climate change and health — should be considered accurate,” said Dr. Jonathan Patz, former director of the Global Health Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who wasn’t part of the study. “Worrisome is our sluggish response to depart from fossil fuels, which the authors show offers enormous immediate health benefits.”

Report authors directly blasted the fossil fuel industry, comparing it to tobacco companies, and the banks that loaned them money.

“All our indicators on the fossil fuel industry are extremely relevant because this is an industry that is actually killing people in large numbers and making them ill in even larger numbers,” said report co-author Paul Ekins, an economics professor at the University College of London. The Lancet report highlighted 68 countries handing out more than $300 billion in subsidies to fossil fuel companies in 2020. The report from the World Resources Institute and others highlighted fossil fuel subsidies as one of six indicators that are not only off track, but going in the wrong direction.

“Fossil fuel consumption subsidies in particular reached an all-time high last year, over $1 trillion, driven by the war in Ukraine and the resulting energy price spikes,” said report co-author Joe Thwaites of the Natural Resources Defense Council environmental group. Fossil fuel subsidies are not only going in the wrong direction, but they’re seeing one of the biggest changes in indicators compared to past years, said study co-author Kelly Levin, science and data director at the Bezos Earth Fund.

Five other categories — the carbon intensity of global steel production, how many miles passenger cars drive, electric buses sold, loss of mangrove forests and amount of food waste — are going in the wrong direction, the State of Climate Action report said.

The only bright spot is that global sales of electric passenger vehicles are now on track to match what’s needed — along with many other changes — to limit future warming to just another couple tenths of a degree, that report found.

“This is not the time for tinkering around the edges, but it’s instead the time for radical decarbonization of all sectors of the economy,” Levin said.

Levin’s report looks at what’s needed in several sectors of the global economy — power, transportation, buildings, industry, finance and forestry — to fit in a world that limits warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) over pre-industrial times, the goal the world adopted at Paris in 2015. The globe has already warmed about 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the mid 19th century. When trying to change an economy, the key is to start with “low-hanging fruit, i.e., the sectors of the economy that are easiest to transition and give a big bang for your buck,” said Dartmouth climate scientist Justin Mankin, who isn’t part of the report. But he said the report shows “we’re really struggling to pick the low-hanging fruit.”

    "23" : """Abinaya Tamilarasu said her four cows are part of the family. She has a degree in commerce from a local college, but prefers being home milking cows and tending to her family’s land.

“Our family cannot let farming go, it’s a way of life for us,” said the 28-year-old, who lives on her family farm in India’s southern Tamil Nadu state. Even when she could be making more money elsewhere, she said she’s “still happy we have our cows.”

India is the world’s largest milk producer, and is home to 80 million dairy farmers who made 231 million tons of milk last year. Many farmers, like Tamilarasu, only have a few cows, but the industry as a whole has 303 million bovine cattle like cows and buffalo, making it the largest contributor to planet-warming methane emissions in the country. The federal government has made some positive steps to reduce methane, but wants to focus emissions cuts elsewhere, like by moving to renewable energy, saying most methane emissions are a fact of life. But experts say the industry can and should make more reductions that can quickly limit warming. India is the third largest emitter of methane in the world, according to figures published earlier this month by the International Energy Agency, and livestock are responsible for about 48% of all methane emissions in India, the vast majority from cattle. Methane is a potent planet-warming gas that can trap more than 80 times more heat in the atmosphere in the short term than carbon dioxide. The Indian government has not joined any global pledges to cut methane emissions, which many see as low-hanging fruit for climate solutions, as methane emissions only last in the atmosphere for about a dozen years, compared to CO2 that can linger for a couple of hundred years.

But there’s some work on methane reduction in agriculture on the national level: The government’s National Dairy Development Board, which works with over 17 million farmers across the country, is looking into genetic improvement programs to provide more nutritious feed to livestock which would make cows more productive, meaning each farmer would need fewer cows to produce the same amount of milk. Studies by the NDDB show that emissions are reduced by as much as 15% when a balanced diet is provided to the animals. The board is also looking into reducing crop burning, a high-emitting practice that some farmers use to clear their lands, by feeding those crops to cows.

“Climate-smart dairying is the need of the hour,” said Meenesh Shah, the board’s chairman. Vineet Kumar, from the New Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment, agreed that good quality feed can help lower emissions. He also said encouraging more local breeds that emit less can help. “These solutions can be a win-win for everyone,” he said.

But Thanammal Ravichandran, a veterinarian based in the southern Indian city of Coimbatore, noted that there’s currently a shortage of feed in India, so farmers give their cattle whatever they can, which is mostly lower quality and higher emitting.

“Farmers are also not able to invest in better quality feed for their cattle,” she said. To get better, and more affordable feed, dairy farmers need more government support, she said.

Whatever measures are taken to reduce methane emissions, experts note that it should have minimal impact on farmers’ livelihoods, and should account for the ways people raise their livestock.

“Livestock have been closely integrated within the Indian farming system,” said Kumar, meaning any drastic changes to farming methods would have severe effects on farmers. He added that efforts to reduce emissions shouldn’t reduce the use of cow manure as fertilizer on India’s farms, as chemical fertilizers emit nitrous oxide, an even more potent greenhouse gas.

But looking at India’s methane emissions as a whole could provide some more obvious solutions to slashing the gas, said Bandish Patel, an energy analyst at the climate thinktank Ember. Focusing on the energy sector is an easy win for targeted reduction of methane emissions, he said. “You look at agriculture, those emissions are very dispersed in nature, whereas, with oil, gas and coal mining, there are very pointed sources from which you can basically reduce methane going forward,” he said.

Shah from the NDDB added that India’s high agricultural emissions must be considered in the context of the country being home to the world’s largest cattle population, the largest producer of milk, and the largest rice exporter, as rice production also produces significant methane emissions.

“In this light, India’s agriculture sector emissions must be considered significantly low,” Shah said. Because of its large population, India’s per capita emissions are well below average.

For dairy farmers like Tamilarasu, better welfare for her cows and programs for farmers to have better practices are welcome, but she won’t be leaving her cows for the climate any time soon. She plans to continue dairy farming for the foreseeable future. “The way we see it, our cows and us support each other. If we can make their lives better, they will make ours better too,” she said.

    "24" : """ Brazilian climatologist Núbia Beray Armond for years had been sounding the alarm about Rio de Janeiro’s need for an extreme heat plan including water distribution. Interest was tepid until a disastrous Taylor Swift concert — and now her phone won’t stop ringing.

A stifling heat wave blanketed southeast Brazil the day of Swift’s concert last November, just before the start of summer in the Southern Hemisphere. Tens of thousands of “Swifties” lined up for hours under a sweltering sun, some huddling beneath umbrellas. Once inside, a group of parched fans managed to get Swift’s attention; she paused her performance to ask staff to provide them with water.

Not everyone was so lucky. Ana Clara Benevides, 23, suffered heat exposure that caused cardiorespiratory arrest during the concert, and she died. Her death sparked outrage. Many accused organizers of failing to deliver sufficient water for concertgoers. Brazil’s justice minister said the death was unacceptable, and his ministry issued a regulation obliging organizers of big events during heat waves to guarantee water for attendees.

Others were galvanized to enshrine water access into law, a sign Brazilian authorities have begun considering it a public health issue in an ever-hotter world. Rio is in the vanguard. Of the almost 100 bills now working their way through municipal, state and federal legislatures, about a third are in Rio state, including the capital, according to an analysis by the consulting firm Governmental Radar, which dubbed it “the Taylor Swift effect.” Many of the bills are named after Benevides.

Niteroi, a city in Rio’s metropolitan region, was first to pass a municipal ordinance guaranteeing water at large events.

“Beyond a shadow of a doubt, Benevides’ death was a turning point in the issue of water distribution for Rio’s public administration,” said Beray Armond, coordinator of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro’s GeoClima laboratory and researcher at Indiana University Bloomington. Brazil’s summer has been particularly oppressive. Nine heat waves swept across the country in 2023, and three since January, according to the government’s meteorology institute.

The heat index — what the temperature feels like to the human body when humidity is combined with air temperature — hit a record 59.3 degrees Celsius (138 Fahrenheit) the day of Swift’s concert. That record has been broken four times since, most recently during the March 11-18 heat wave, when the heat index reached 62.3 degrees Celsius (144 Fahrenheit) on Sunday. In Rio, people sought relief at beaches such as Copacabana and Ipanema. Thousands of colorful parasols fluttered in the sea breeze, and people dipped into the waves. But some, like 43-year-old Eduardo Alves de Castro, found it hard to relax.

“It’s worrisome because we wonder how far these high temperatures are heading. The concern is that there’s no end to it. We are in a very privileged place: Here in front of the beach, you cool off, but there are people in a much less favorable situation, and who are much more affected,” Castro said.

During heat waves, those unable to afford power bills from round-the-clock air conditioning often cool down with multiple showers a day, which deplete a shared tank or run up water bills.

Many people in favelas — urban, working-class neighborhoods — didn’t pay for water until three private companies assumed concessions in 2021 and began installing water meters. The largest of them, Waters of Rio, said in an email it has provided water to an additional 300,000 people since taking over.

Daiane Nunes, who lives in Rio’s Rocinha favela, regularly treks uphill to a natural water source in the forest. She and fellow residents fill bottles in a small flow of water there.

“The water that comes from our pipes is impossible to drink because it contains a lot of chlorine. Apart from buying water, this is our only chance of getting natural water,” said Nunes, 33.

Water shortages for poor, non-white populations is a worldwide phenomenon growing increasingly severe as global temperatures rise. Brazilian states and municipalities need to develop plans for water distribution, determine the costs and adopt the best means of management, said Luana Pretto, executive president of the Treat Brazil Institute, a think tank that advocates for basic sanitation and protection of water resources.

In Rio, ahead of World Water Day on Friday, people crowded into a hotel’s conference room in the city center to share their stories of trouble accessing water.

Water is intermittent in Jardim Gramacho, a neighborhood beside what until 2012 was Latin America’s biggest landfill. That was distressing to Fatima Monteiro, a community health agent who suffers from high blood pressure, which puts her at greater risk of blackouts and fainting during heat waves. She dug herself a makeshift well. “I had to. I didn’t know how to live with the lack of water,” said Monteiro, who attended the conference. Aware that the runoff from landfill had caused water pollution, she said that to be safe she uses the well water only for cooking and washing.

Days after Benevides’ death, City Hall announced 150 designated areas within health posts where people suffering from dehydration could receive saline solution to mitigate the impacts of heat waves.

During Carnival festivities in February, the Waters of Rio concessionaire distributed water at the Sambadrome, where dancers in heavy costumes parade alongside gigantic floats. The company handed out water to parade-goers congregating before they entered the avenue, and after the parade following an hour of sweaty exertion.

But even as authorities attempt to grapple with the problem, there have been shortcomings.

Soccer fans complained they were barred from entering Maracana stadium with water bottles ahead of the game last Sunday — the same day the heat index hit 62.3 degrees Celsius. Brazil’s justice ministry asked for clarification from Maracana’s administrators, citing obligations of the regulation issued in the wake of Swift’s November show.

Rio also moved to install free water dispensers. But as summer winds down, just one has been established so far, in the wealthy Ipanema neighborhood — and even it is proving less effective than desired. An Associated Press reporter visited the dispenser in the sweltering heat Wednesday and helped children struggling to use it, which requires scanning a QR code and filling out an online form. A man without a cellphone couldn’t get water.

While Beray Armond welcomed Rio’s nascent attempts to provide water, she is waiting to see if the recently proposed bills are actually enacted into law.

“If you don’t have legislation that forces public or private entities to distribute water, you’re basically condemning your population to illness or death,” Beray Armond said. “We still need to improve, but it’s better than before, when we had nothing.”
