    "1": """Every day this week, hundreds of visitors to the National Gallery in London have marveled at “After Impressionism” — an acclaimed exhibition examining how, at the turn of the 20th century, painters including Van Gogh, Cézanne and Picasso pushed art in bold new directions.

So, too, have art lovers visiting an institution 1,700 miles away: the Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, in Moscow.
    
Before Russia invaded Ukraine, the two museums were collaborating on a single “After Impressionism” show, which would bring together masterpieces from each institution’s vast museum holdings. The exhibition was to open in London and then travel to Moscow. Now the shows are divorced; the National Gallery’s version of Cézanne’s “Bathers” will be seen only in London, while Henri Matisse’s “The Pink Studio,” a major painting of bright color and vivid decoration from 1911, will stay put in Moscow.

Over the past year, the National Gallery’s curators searched worldwide for paintings and sculptures to replace the 15 masterpieces that had been expected from Russia. The Pushkin’s curators, in turn, refocused its “After Impressionism,” which opened on Tuesday, toward Russian artists. Last year, Olga Lyubimova, Russia’s culture minister, said it was vital that exhibitions that had been planned with foreign museums went ahead, even when those museums now refused to loan works to Russia.

At a time when Western opera houses and concert halls are grappling with whether to resume work with Russian singers and musicians, the bifurcated “After Impression” exhibition shows that Western museums are holding firm in deciding to cut off Russian state institutions until the war is over. Although phone calls between colleagues on both sides continue, Russian museums are otherwise sealed off from Western influences and partnerships.

In recent statements, Russia’s culture ministry has downplayed the impact of isolation, and trumpeted potential cultural collaborations with nations that have not condemned the war, including China, Oman, and even Cuba.

MaryAnne Stevens, the lead curator of the National Gallery’s “After Impressionism,” said in an interview that the situation felt like a throwback to the 1970s, when Westerners struggled to borrow from Russia’s incredible collections of art and were hampered in academic research. “It’s deeply depressing and very saddening,” she said.

That sense of Russia being shut off has only grown in recent weeks as the government changed the leadership at several of Moscow’s biggest museums, pushing out directors that promoted joint projects with Western institutions.

Last month, Marina Loshak, the Pushkin’s longtime director and a driving force behind the joint “After Impressionism” show, resigned after 10 years in the role.

In a statement on the Puskin’s social media accounts, she said it was time for a new director “to come with new energy, with new thoughts and with new ambitions.” But to many in Russia, Loshak’s position had become untenable because her daughter, Anna Mongayt, is an opposition journalist who opposes the war. Loshak said in an interview with The Art Newspaper Russia that she wanted to leave the Pushkin on her own terms. Loshak was replaced by Elizaveta Likhacheva, previously the head of Russia’s Shchusev Museum of Architecture.

In February, there was a similar changing of the guard at the State Tretyakov Gallery, another of Moscow’s major museums, when the culture ministry announced the abrupt dismissal of Zelfira Tregulova, the Tretyakov Gallery’s steadfastly independent director since 2015. She was replaced by Elena Pronicheva, who previously ran the Polytechnic Museum, a science collection, in Moscow.

Under Tregulova’s leadership, the Tretyakov Gallery staged or hosted several surprising contemporary art shows — including one that celebrated diversity and European unity — and lent works from its collection across Europe. In January, the ministry wrote to the museum urging it to do more to promote “traditional Russian spiritual and moral values,” according to a report in The Moscow Times. A few weeks later, the ministry decided not to renew Tregulova’s contract. Tregulova told reporters she learned of the decision in the press.
    
Both Loshak and Tregulova turned down interview requests for this article; the Pushkin and Tretyakov museums did not respond to similar requests.

Catherine Phillips, a British art historian who had worked with the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg since the 1990s, said in an interview that although the changes were stark, they seemed more about the government wanting to show its power over cultural life, rather than seeking to alter the museums’ content or “micromanage the culture.”

Yet there has been a more patriotic turn in the past decade in some of Russia’s museums, particularly its military and historical institutions. Over the past year, Lyubimova, the culture minister, has visited and praised several such shows, including a Moscow exhibition venerating Russia’s warrior saints. The show had perhaps been conceived “in a completely different setting, with a different message,” she said, according to a news release, but it was “all the more providential to open this exhibition today.”

Of all of Russia’s museums, the Hermitage — founded in the 18th century by Catherine the Great, a German princess who became Russia’s empress — has had the greatest ties to Western Europe. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Hermitage recalled numerous loans, including Fabergé eggs at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, paintings at the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris and a Picasso portrait from an Italian museum.

The Hermitage’s director, Mikhail Piotrovsky, remains in place. The museum’s head since 1990, Piotrovsky is close to President Vladimir Putin of Russia and has made statements backing Russia’s invasion. Last year, in an interview with a Russian newspaper, Piotrovsky, said he felt “stabbed in the back” when foreign museums cut ties with his institution.

In an emailed statement, Piotrovsky said “the blockade of Russia’s museums” had forced the museum to change how it operates. “We have been looking into the opportunities for holding exhibitions from private collections and from friendly countries,” he said.

With fewer international tourists, the museum is pivoting to maintain its global presence. Piotrovsky said the Hermitage was becoming more active online, a move that includes offering virtual museum tours. In March, the museum began broadcasting live feeds from webcams trained on of two of its greatest modern masterpieces — Matisse’s “Dance” and “Music” — so that art lovers outside Russia could still see them.

The museum would also work outside Russia by hosting events in Asia, the Middle East and the Balkans, Piotrovsky said, but did not explain what those would involve.

Officially, Russia’s museums may now be looking Eastward, but Vladimir Opredelenov, a former deputy director at the Pushkin Museum, who left after Russia’s invasion, said in an email interview that Western and Russian museums were still collaborating, just in “more veiled and bizarre forms” rather than via official channels.

Once the war’s over, “we will see that museums will be among the first to set an example” and resume cultural exchange, he added, because “both sides equally understand the value of maintaining human relationships.”

Until then, Opredelenov said, Russian museums need to work with countries in the Middle East and Asia to help spread their creativity: “I hope that the world community understands and accepts this.”

    "2": """ The stoops of brownstone Brooklyn, on which residents routinely leave freebies for passers-by, are a reliable metric of current literary tastes — and distastes. In that fervid summer of 2018 when prominent men were being publicly accused of bad behavior right and left, I found there juxtaposed Woody Allen’s “Side Effects” and Garrison Keillor’s “Lake Wobegon Days,” amusing in a way those humorists never intended. Nearby, someone had huffily discarded a copy of Mario Batali’s “Molto Italiano.” My shelf of scandal was getting more stuffed than one of his delectable vongole origanate.

Over on the West Coast, in Seattle, the author Claire Dederer had discovered a similar phenomenon: a Little Free Library “absolutely crammed to its tiny rafters with books by and about” Allen, which she decided to gather as research. “An ill-gotten Woody Allen book was a book I hadn’t paid for — the perfect way to consume the art of someone whose morals you question,” she writes in her own new book, “Monsters: A Fan’s Dilemma,” a cross-disciplinary consideration of such polarizing figures, and of the ethics of a creative life.

“Everyone alive,” Dederer writes, “is either canceled or about to be canceled.” But she has no use for the term “cancel culture,” privileging, as it does, the person shamed by the red stamp of accusation, rather than the one who pipes up about wrongdoing. And she nonetheless wants to find a way to reconcile her appreciation of great art with the real-life misdeeds of its creators.

Expanding on a popular essay published in The Paris Review a month after the exposure of Harvey Weinstein’s sexual predation, “Monsters” sustains an essayistic, sometimes aphoristic tone throughout 250-odd pages. Dotted with details of her particular milieu — the ferryboat, the crepe shop, the rock show that leaves glitter in the eyelashes — “Monsters” is part memoir, part treatise and all treat. Dederer is continually trying — not in the adjectival sense, but as the present participle: showing us her thought process, correcting as she goes and experimenting with different forms.

She renders an argument with an unnamed tweedy “male writer” about Allen’s 1979 movie “Manhattan,” for example, as a “little play” set in the marble-lined restaurant at the Met Breuer (itself an echt “Manhattan” setting), observing “a clink of silverware around the room, as if the knives and forks were having another conversation, a clearer and cleaner conversation, underneath or above the meaty human rumble.”

Dederer, the “female writer” — and a nimble, witty one — has come to believe that the nonchalance with which Allen’s character dates a high schooler ruins the film, which has always faintly disturbed her, especially since the director left Mia Farrow for her daughter Soon-Yi Previn. The male writer takes the New Critical position that she should judge “Manhattan” just on aesthetics, and that it’s a masterpiece.

Woody Allen has already taken up too much space in this review. The so-called monster — a term that, handily, can denote success and size as well as deviance — has a way of doing that.

Dederer flips through an entire rogues’ gallery, which includes plenty of men yet also a surprising number of women: J.K. Rowling, of course, whose Harry Potter series had enraptured Dederer’s family before she spoke about transgender issues; but also Virginia Woolf, whose diaries were “pocked” with “flippant antisemitic remarks” though she was married to a Jew; Willa Cather, who dehumanized Black people in “My Ántonia”; Laura Ingalls Wilder, who dehumanized Native Americans in the “Little House” series; and Doris Lessing, who left two children behind when she moved from Rhodesia to London with the third.

“This is what female monstrousness looks like: abandoning the kids. Always,” declares Dederer, a mother of two still feeling guilty about a decade of drinking and a five-week retreat to Marfa, Texas. Here I’d argue with her (and I don’t think she’d mind; she is continually arguing with herself). Unless not having children, like Woolf, constitutes a kind of abandonment?

“Monster” turns out to be but one of several words the author carefully palpates, finding it “male, testicular, old world. It’s a hairy word, and has teeth.” It conjures childhood fear and fantasy, like the creatures in “Where the Wild Things Are,” whose author, Maurice Sendak, is in some quarters absurdly demonized, or the works of Roald Dahl: less absurdly demonized, for unflippant antisemitism. (“If we give up the antisemites,” remarks one of Dederer’s friends in what is actually kind of a Woody Allenish joke, “we’ll have to give up everyone.” )

“Am I a Monster?” Dederer titles one chapter, assessing her own relative rectitude. In the next breath, she assesses her own career — she has published well-received books on yoga and sex — “maybe I’m not monstrous enough.” Art requires selfishness; geniuses get a “hall pass” on having to conform to society’s expectations. If only one could keep the passionate, voracious part of monsterdom without leaving teeth marks in other people.

“Stain” is another piece of vocabulary Dederer finds useful, though Philip Roth’s “The Human Stain” is not among the many works analyzed here, and Roth is mentioned only in passing, despite the very interesting case of sexual misconduct accusations against his biographer that has jeopardized Roth’s legacy.

Maybe that’s because “biography,” to Dederer, seems not so much noble genre as ubiquitous nuisance, a “disrupter of my own pleasure”: just a set of personal details you can search for on that most monstrous of modern entities, the internet. “We swim in biography; we are sick with biography,” she writes. It “used to be something you sought out, yearned for, actively pursued. Now it falls on your head all day long.”

Corollary to the “monster,” more passive, is the “stain”: some ugliness coloring someone’s life that you don’t want to know, that nonetheless spreads and can ruin perception of his or her work. Stains seep through time, to the people who hurt the artist and the people the artist hurt, and in these days of heightened parasocial relationships, the people he or she hurts include us: the fan who knew too much.

Every fan’s shelf of scandal, the books  snatched furtively off the stoop, looks different. Dederer’s: light on Roth, laden with Vladimir Nabokov. Her exquisitely reasoned vindication of “Lolita” brought tears of gratitude to my eyes.

But I also found myself disagreeing with or questioning a lot, resisting her sweeping “we” (a pronoun she herself interrogates). I don’t think of the comedian Michael Richards’s 2006 racist tirade every time I catch glimpses of him bursting through the door on “Seinfeld.” (Should I?) Neither, presumably, does the hilarious young comedian Troy Bond, who regularly does a modernized parody of the show on TikTok.

I don’t think the word “ambition” attached to a woman is pejorative anymore. I don’t think women who complete their work — “finishers,” Dederer calls them — are in any way monstrous or comparable to male predators. They’re A students! Or just being professional.

And I definitely don’t think, as she asserts, that “pregnancy is the end of narrative.” This from someone who spends pages luxuriating guiltily in “Rosemary’s Baby,” trying to solve “the problem of Roman Polanski.”  What about John Updike’s “Couples”? (Don’t get me started on how The London Review of Books monsterized Updike, above Patricia Lockwood’s essay, as a “malfunctioning sex robot.”)

For an author who rightly shudders over the cheapening of the word “obsessed” to use the phrases “make work” — the new “make love”? — and “late capitalism” leaves me feeling, as Dederer would herself put it, “a little urpy.”

But, but … this is a book that looks boldly down the cliff at the roiling waters below and jumps right in, splashes around playfully, isn’t afraid to get wet. How refreshing.

    "3":""" On a recent sunny morning on the banks of the Adda River in northern Italy, schoolchildren on a class trip to Imbersago — the “Town of the Ferry of Leonardo da Vinci” — gathered next to a moored boat and listened as a guide explained how the flights of the river’s birds, the formations of its rocks and the workings of its ships inspired Leonardo’s genius.

“Why doesn’t it move?” one of the students interrupted, pointing to the ferry, which sat behind a chain and a sign reading, “Service suspended.” It looked like a deserted summer deck atop two rowboats.

“The water needs to be high enough for the current to move it,” answered Sara Asperti, 45. “Also, they’re looking for a new ferryman. So if any of you are interested.”

Since at least 500 years ago, when the opposing banks of the Adda belonged to the Duchy of Milan and the Republic of Venice, ferries have run on water currents and a taut rope above a narrow stretch of the river. Leonardo spent a lot of time in the area and sketched the motorless ferry around 1513. Later, the invention of the ferry, or its improvement, was attributed to him, though locals say no one knows for sure.

In the past century, reproductions of the original ferries have linked Italy’s Lecco and Bergamo Provinces, allowing knitwear factory workers to commute, a young Pope John XXIII to visit a favorite shrine and, more recently, tourists and cyclists to enjoy the nature paths and yellow fields of rapeseed.

But a year after Italy’s worst drought in seven decades — when much of Europe gasped for precipitation — a winter without much rain or snow has turned into a dry spring across the country’s north. In Piedmont, water tanks are already supplying a small mountain village with drinking water. The Po River valley, usually lush and rich in rice, is parched. In March, a member of Parliament brandished river stones that he collected from the dry Adige River to accuse Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of inaction.

“I’m not Moses,” she responded.

This month, the government established a task force to tackle the scarcity of rainfall, which has also hit the Adda, where swans glide on water so low that islands have emerged, rowboats are beached and the last of what the town calls “Leonardesque” ferries has become a stationary landmark.

“If it becomes a monument, or something static, it loses its meaning,” said Fabio Vergani, Imbersago’s mayor, as he sat on the ferry, big enough to hold three cars or scores of people, but now empty. The boat was a tourist draw and an economic engine, he said, but more important, it was “the family jewel of the town — we cannot be left without it.”

The painful case of the ferry, the mayor said, was “evidence of a global problem.” He continued: “It’s not science fiction. We are feeling the real effects. What was the problem of North Africa is maybe going to be the reality of southern Europe. A lack of rain and desertification of the territory.”

But some of the townspeople say an Italian problem more daunting than climate change is the real culprit for the ferry’s immobility since May.

“Bureaucracy,” said John Codara, who owns the gelato shop next to the ferry.

Since the last ferry operators left to run a more lucrative water taxi in Lake Como, no one has bid to take over the 4,500-euro-a-year concession, even though the town has thrown in a mountain bike rental as a deal sweetener.

The mayor says no one wants to operate the ferry because it cannot function with weak currents, and tried to explain as much to Mr. Codara in his cafe. But the gelato maker wasn’t buying it. After the mayor left, Mr. Codara, who fielded calls from interested locals — “You should see the hair on this guy,” he said, cupping the phone — remained convinced that the engineering of the ferry could handle low water.

“I mean Leonardo wasn’t a moron,” he said, under a framed picture of Leonardo. He demonstrated how the ferry worked on a small wooden model made by a local pensioner — “It’s to scale; it’s worth 500 euros,” or nearly $550, and argued that low water and weak currents meant operators required elbow grease to move it across the cable connecting the two banks.

“The force of the ferry is these,” Mr. Codara said, pointing at his biceps.

What they did not need was an advanced nautical degree, he said, as he marched out of his cafe and made a beeline for a sign honoring “The Human Face of the Ferry” and its pilots over the past century. “Harvard, Harvard, Harvard,” Mr. Codara said with derision as he pointed at the names. “They all went to Harvard.”

Roberto Spada, 75, whose father was one of those ferrymen, said he helped navigate the ferry as a 12-year-old and was interested in helping out the town by doing it again as a volunteer.

“I thought with my license I could do it,” Mr. Spada told the mayor as they leaned against other signs posted next to the ferry that featured both Leonardo’s sketch and an excerpt from Dante’s “Inferno” about Charon, “ferryman of the damned.”

A retired truck driver and president of the local fishing association — which has the ferry as its logo — Mr. Spada had a boating license but seemed bewildered as the mayor explained all of the certifications and bureaucratic hoops that needed to be jumped through to pilot the ferry.

“It’s a really long process,” said Mr. Vergani, the mayor.

In the meantime, the river is at one of its lowest depths in decades.

Volunteers tending to flower beds along the riverbank were finding the dirt so dry that they put down their hoes and used a leaf blower to tidy up. Cyclists stepped over the chain, their biking shoes clicking on the ferry platform, to commiserate about the low level of the river. One of them, Roberto Valsecchi, 63, who recalled crossing with his car on the ferry as a teenager, worried that the paltry snowfall on the ski slopes this winter meant “we will suffer this summer.”

Mr. Vergani worried that even if the skies opened, officials at Lake Como, which fed the river, would hoard the water and “keep the tap closed” to ensure the lake’s own survival. The situation looked bleak. The area’s hydroelectric plants had already started rationing water.

Giuseppina Di Paola, 64, paused from feeding geese to talk about how she used to take her mountain bike on the ferry, but now walked along the banks, where “I found a lot of dead fish.”

Flavio Besana, 70, an environmental guard of the local park, was spending his day off walking the centuries-old path beside the river. He pointed to the boulders considered the inspiration for the landscape in Leonardo’s “Virgin of the Rocks.”

“All of that is usually covered with water,” Mr. Besana said, pointing at the bottom of the boulder. “In 40 years, I’ve never seen the river like this.”

Near Imbersago’s small town center, the roundabout is adorned with a large wooden model of the ferry. The loss of the main attraction means tourism on the weekdays has slowed to a trickle. Valentino Riva, 66, whose father was a ferryman in the 1970s, ironed shirts in the dry-cleaning shop off the main square and recalled more buoyant days.

“There used to be people in the piazza,” he said, as the iron hissed. “Those times are finished.”

Evening fell and the day’s gentle breeze died down, leaving the river as still as a tar pit. Across the water, on the Bergamo side, Angela Maestroni, 64, sat with her husband next to Leonardo da Vinci Street and in front of the small port where the ferry no longer goes. They reminisced about commuting on the ferry, watched the birds and fretted about the future.

“It’s months that it doesn’t rain,” she said. “The summers are so much hotter. Last year, the sun burned everything.”

Just then, a light drizzle fell from the sky, pockmarking the river and spotting the ferry platform on the other shore. Then, just as suddenly, it stopped and the sky cleared.

“It’s two drops,” she said. “It’s not enough.”

    "4" : """ When Brian Maracle returned in his mid-40s to the Mohawk community near Toronto that he had left when he was just 5, he didn’t have a job and knew almost no one there.

But perhaps the biggest challenge facing him was that he neither spoke nor understood much Kanyen’keha, the Mohawk language. More than a century of attempts by Canada’s government to stamp out Indigenous cultures had left Mr. Maracle and many other Indigenous people without their languages.

Now, 30 years later, Mr. Maracle has become a champion of Mohawk, and is helping revive it and other Indigenous languages, both in Canada and elsewhere, through his transformation of teaching methods.

“I never studied linguistics, don’t have any teacher training, my parents weren’t speakers,” he said in his office at an adult language school he founded about two decades ago in his community, the Six Nations of the Grand River territory, southwest of Toronto. Yet, linguistics academic conferences now feature him as a speaker.
Innovative approaches like Mr. Maracle’s are crucial, experts say, to overcoming the suppression of Indigenous languages and cultures in Canada.

From the 19th century into the 1990s, thousands of Indigenous students were taken from their homes, sometimes by force, and placed into Canada’s residential schools system. There, they were forbidden from speaking their languages and from practicing their traditions in what a national commission later characterized as “cultural genocide.”

The system failed to entirely eradicate Indigenous languages, but its effect was nevertheless devastating for the 60 Indigenous languages found in Canada.

Today restoring Indigenous languages has been a component of Canada’s push for reconciliation with its Indigenous people, a top priority of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government. Four years ago, the government passed the Indigenous Languages Act, which formally recognizes the importance of these languages and requires the allocation of money — more than 700 million Canadian dollars to date — for teaching them.

But none of that was around when Mr. Maracle arrived at Six Nations, and the program that was available, he found, was ill-suited for adult students.

“Indigenous languages are extremely different from English,” said Ivona Kucerova, the director of the Center for Advanced Research in Experimental and Applied Linguistics at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. “But typically what you see is that the local Indigenous language teaching methodologies are designed to teach Western languages.”

Mr. Maracle said the problem with his first, unsuccessful lesson was that the instructors, generally Mohawk elders without training as language teachers, were tossing out “whole words.”

“They just expected by dropping a word on you and saying it louder that you’d somehow figure it out,” Mr. Maracle said. “They didn’t understand how the language really is structured.”

A small grant allowed Mr. Maracle and three other people from Six Nations to try to determine exactly what that structure was.

Mr. Maracle found the answer about 25 years ago in the office of David Kanatawakhon-Maracle, no direct relation, a lecturer at the Western University in London, Ontario.

“There were little bits of paper all over this big table,” Mr. Maracle recalled. The lecturer told Mr. Maracle words he had been longing to hear: “He said: ‘I think I’ve got a new way of teaching the language.’”

There were about 60 slips of paper on his office table, and they “were the Rosetta Stone of all the things that you need to be a competent beginning speaker,” Mr. Maracle said.

Kanyen’keha is a polysynthetic language, where a single word can function as an entire sentence. Those words are made up of morphemes, small elements that change their meaning depending on how they are combined.

The slips of paper contained the morphemes, which are the building blocks for the entire language.

“This was huge,” Mr. Maracle said.

Understanding that these elements were the key to unlocking the language was the breakthrough Mr. Maracle needed to attain fluency. But other students at the school he helped start in 1999 were still struggling. It became apparent that someone needed to build a curriculum and teaching program around the morphemes, including a color-coded system for grouping them, which Mr. Maracle did through trial and error.

One essential discovery was figuring out that learning Kanyen’keha requires “looking at the world with Mohawk language eyes,” he said.

In comparison with other languages, Kanyen’keha relies heavily on verbs. Objects are generally described by what they do. The word for “computer,” for example, roughly translates as “it brings things up.”

So its speakers, Mr. Maracle said, need to analyze the world in terms of action rather than objects.

“We don’t teach you how to say “pencil,” “chair,” ”shoe” for six months,” Mr. Maracle said. “Because the language is a verb-based language, the names of things are less grammatically important.”

Prof. Kucerova, the director of the linguistics center in Hamilton, regards Mr. Maracle as a linguist despite his lack of formal training. She said tests showed that his students emerged with a university-level fluidity in two years.

“I have never seen anyone else bring adult learners to that level of language, to be able to speak at this level after two years,” she said, adding that Mohawk ranks with Arabic in terms of difficulty for English-speaking students. “That’s really astonishing.”

“I became literally mesmerized by the extent of his work,” Prof. Kucerova said. “ He’s figured out this improbable, but linguistically extremely smart, method of delivering this radically different language to adults.”

Born in Detroit, Mr. Maracle spent most of his first five years in Six Nations, but later in his childhood lived in Buffalo and Rochester in New York, and Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, as his father, a carpenter, moved for work.

After graduating from Dartmouth College, he studied journalism and worked as a reporter for The Globe and Mail newspaper. He was also the host of an Indigenous radio program for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation before moving back to Six Nations.

Mr. Maracle, 76, recently retired from the language school he founded — Onkwawenna Kentyohkwa, or Our Language Society — but he remains active in a number of its programs.

The school has its offices in an Indigenous community services building in the village of Ohsweken, Ontario, the sprawling First Nation’s administrative center. It can afford to accept only about a dozen students a year; its first grants from the federal government arrived just in 2021. Before then, it was largely financed by the community.

There are no concrete figures of current Kanyen’keha speakers in the area, but the local branch of the Royal Bank of Canada, Canada’s largest financial institution, now has signs in Kanyen’keha and employees who speak the language. Signs in the language around the community warn motorists to not text and drive.

The school’s students have included Marc Miller, the current federal minister of Indigenous relations, who after some part time studies, became the first lawmaker to address Canada’s Parliament in an Indigenous language since Confederation in 1867.

Mr. Maracle said the most important difference he has seen is that Kanyen’keha is no longer spoken only by older people, but used more often by the young, in their homes, with their immediate families and in everyday situations.

“I think people are finally coming around to the realization that the public schools and technology are not going to save our languages,” he said, adding, “You have to enable young adults to become speakers so that they can raise children as first language speakers.”

    "5" : """ Oh, Possums, Dame Edna is no more.

To be unflinchingly precise, Barry Humphries, the Australian-born actor and comic who for almost seven decades brought that divine doyenne of divadom, Dame Edna Everage, to delirious, dotty, disdainful Dadaist life, died on Saturday in Sydney. He was 89.

His death was confirmed by the hospital where he had spent several days after undergoing hip surgery. In a tribute message posted on Twitter, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia praised Mr. Humphries as “a great wit, satirist, writer and an absolute one-of-kind.”

A stiletto-heeled, stiletto-tongued persona who might well have been the spawn of a ménage à quatre involving Oscar Wilde, Salvador Dalí, Auntie Mame and Miss Piggy, Dame Edna was not so much a character as a cultural phenomenon, a force of nature trafficking in wicked, sequined commentary on the nature of fame.

For generations after the day she first sprang to life on the Melbourne stage, Dame Edna reigned, bewigged, bejeweled and bejowled, as one of the longest-lived characters to be channeled by a single performer. She toured worldwide in a series of solo stage shows and was ubiquitous on television in the United States, Britain, Australia and elsewhere.

A master improviser (many of Dame Edna’s most stinging barbs were ad-libbed) with a face like taffy, Mr. Humphries was widely esteemed as one of the world’s foremost theatrical clowns.

“I’ve only seen one man have power over an audience like that,” the theater critic John Lahr told him, after watching Dame Edna night after night in London. “My father.” Mr. Lahr’s father was the great stage and cinematic clown Bert Lahr.

Mr. Humphries conceived Edna in 1955 as Mrs. Norm Everage, typical Australian housewife. “Everage,” after all, is Australian for “average.”

Housewife, Superstar, National Treasure

But Edna soon became a case study in exorbitant amour propre, lampooning suburban pretensions, political correctness and the cult of celebrity, and acquiring a damehood along the way. A “housewife-superstar,” she called herself, upgrading the title in later years to “megastar” and, still later, to “gigastar.”

In Britain, where Mr. Humphries had long made his home, Dame Edna was considered a national treasure, a paragon of performance art long before the term was coined.

In the United States, she starred in a three-episode series, “Dame Edna’s Hollywood,” a mock celebrity talk show broadcast on NBC in the early 1990s, and was a frequent guest on actual talk shows.

She performed several times on Broadway, winning Mr. Humphries a special Tony Award, as well as Drama Desk and Theater World Awards, for “Dame Edna: The Royal Tour,” his 1999 one-person show.

In her stage and TV shows, written largely by Mr. Humphries, Dame Edna typically made her entrance tottering down a grand staircase (Mr. Humphries was more than six feet tall) in a tsunami of sequins, her hair a bouffant violet cloud (she was “a natural wisteria,” she liked to say), her evening gown slit to the thigh to reveal Mr. Humphries’s surprisingly good legs, her body awash in jewels, her eyes agape behind sprawling rhinestone glasses (“face furniture,” she called them).

Addressing the audience, she delivered her signature greeting, “Hellooooo, Possums!”

By turns tender and astringent, Dame Edna called audience members “possums” often. She also called them other things, as when, leaning across the footlights, she would address a woman in the front row in a confiding, carrying voice: “I know, dear. I used to make my own clothes, too.”

Performances concluded with Dame Edna flinging hundreds of gladioli into the crowd, no mean feat aerodynamically. “Wave your gladdies, Possums!” she exhorted audience members who caught them, and the evening would end, to music, with a mass valedictory swaying.

Between the “Hellooooo” and the gladdies, Dame Edna’s audiences were treated to a confessional monologue deliciously akin to finding oneself stranded in a hall of vanity mirrors.

There was commentary on her husband and children (“I made a decision: I put my family last”); her beauty regimen (“Good self-esteem is very important. I look in the mirror and say, ‘Edna, you are gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous’”); and the constellation of luminaries who routinely sought her counsel, among them Queen Elizabeth II and her family. (“I’ve had to change my telephone number several times to stop them ringing me.”)

Dame Edna’s TV shows were often graced by actual celebrity guests, including Zsa Zsa Gabor, Charlton Heston, Sean Connery, Robin Williams and Lauren Bacall.

They came in for no less of a drubbing than the audience did, starting with the inaugural affront, the affixing of immense name tags to their lapels — for eclipsed by the light of gigastardom so close at hand, who among us would not be reduced to anonymity?

“Chuck,” Mr. Heston’s name tag read. Ms. Gabor received two: a “Zsa” for the right shoulder and a “Zsa” for the left.

A few pleasantries were exchanged before Dame Edna moved in for the kill.

“You’ve had nine hits this year,” she purred fawningly at the singer-songwriter Michael Bolton on one of her British TV shows. “On your website.”

Turning to the audience after delivering a particularly poisonous insult, she would ooze, “I mean that in the most caring way.”

Those guests who emerged relatively unscathed had the savvy to take Dame Edna at face value and interact with her as though she were real. The moment he donned those rhinestone glasses, Mr. Humphries often said, Dame Edna became real to him too, an entirely separate law unto herself.

‘I Wish I’d Thought of That’

“I’m, as it were, in the wings, and she’s onstage,” he explained in a 2015 interview with Australian television. “And every now and then she says something extremely funny, and I stand there and think, ‘I wish I’d thought of that.’”

But the truly funny thing, Possums, is that when Mr. Humphries first brought Dame Edna to life, he intended her to last only a week or so. What was more, she was meant to have been played by the distinguished actress Zoe Caldwell.

Mr. Humphries created a string of other characters over the years, notably the boorish, bibulous Australian cultural attaché Sir Les Patterson. But it was Dame Edna, the outlandish aunt who engenders adoration and mortification in equal measure, who captivated the public utterly — despite the fact that in later years, her mortification-inducing lines sometimes landed her, and her creator, in trouble.

So fully did Mr. Humphries animate Edna that he was at continued pains to point out that he was neither a female impersonator in the conventional sense nor a cross-dresser in any sense.

“Mr. Humphries, do you ever have to take your children aside and explain to them why you like to wear women’s clothes?” an American interviewer once asked him.

“If I were an actor playing Hamlet,” he replied, “would I have to take my children aside and say I wasn’t really Danish?’”

By all accounts far more erudite than Dame Edna — he was an accomplished painter, bibliophile and art collector — Mr. Humphries, in a sustained act of self-protection, always spoke of her in the third person.

She did likewise. “My manager,” she disdainfully called him. (She also called Mr. Humphries “a money-grubbing little slug” and accused him of embezzling her fortune. He did, it must be said, cash a great many of her checks.)

But as dismissive of her creator as Dame Edna was, she rallied to his aid when he very likely needed her most: after years of alcoholism culminated in stays in psychiatric hospitals and at least one brush with the law.

‘I Hated Her’

John Barry Humphries was born in Kew, a Melbourne suburb, on Feb. 17, 1934. His father, Eric, was a prosperous builder; his mother, Louisa, was a homemaker.

From his earliest childhood in Camberwell, a more exclusive suburb, he felt oppressed by the bourgeois conformism that enveloped his parents and their circle, and depressed by his mother’s cold suburban propriety.

Dame Edna was a response to those forces.

“I invented Edna because I hated her,” Mr. Humphries was quoted as saying in Mr. Lahr’s book “Dame Edna Everage and the Rise of Western Civilization: Backstage With Barry Humphries” (1992). “I poured out my hatred of the standards of the little people of their generation.”

Dame Edna emerged when the young Mr. Humphries, under the sway of Dadaism, was performing with a repertory company based at the University of Melbourne; he had dropped out of the university two years before.

On long bus tours, he entertained his colleagues with the character of Mrs. Norm Everage — born Edna May Beazley in Wagga Wagga, Australia, sometime in the 1930s — an ordinary housewife who had found sudden acclaim after winning a nationwide competition, the Lovely Mother Quest.

Unthinkable as it seems, Edna was dowdy then, given to mousy brown hair and pillbox hats. But she was already in full command of the arsenal of bourgeois bigotries that would be a hallmark of her later self.

For a revue by the company in December 1955, Mr. Humphries wrote a part for Edna, earmarked for Ms. Caldwell, an Australian contemporary. But when she proved too busy to oblige, he donned a dress and played it himself. After Edna proved a hit with Melbourne audiences, he performed the character elsewhere in the country.

By the end of the 1950s, hoping to make a career as a serious actor, Mr. Humphries had moved to London, where Edna met with little enthusiasm and was largely shelved. (She blamed Mr. Humphries ever after for her lack of early success there.)

Mr. Humphries played Mr. Sowerberry, the undertaker, in the original West End production of the musical “Oliver!” in 1960, and reprised the role when the show came to Broadway in 1963.

But though he worked steadily during the ’60s, he was also in the fierce grip of alcoholism. Stays in psychiatric hospitals, he later said, were of no avail.

His nadir came in 1970, when he awoke in a Melbourne gutter to find himself under arrest.

With a doctor’s help, Mr. Humphries became sober soon afterward; he did not take a drink for the rest of his life. He dusted off Dame Edna and, little by little, de-dowdified her. By the late ’70s, with celebrity culture in full throttle, she had given him international renown and unremitting employment.

Edna did not seduce every critic. Reviewing her first New York stage show, the Off Broadway production “Housewife! Superstar!!,” in The New York Times in 1977, Richard Eder called it “abysmal.”

Nor did Edna’s resolute lack of political correctness always stand her, or Mr. Humphries, in good stead. In February 2003, writing an advice column as Dame Edna in Vanity Fair, he replied to a reader’s query about whether to learn Spanish.

“Who speaks it that you are really desperate to talk to?” Dame Edna’s characteristically caustic response read. “The help? Your leaf blower? Study French or German, where there are at least a few books worth reading, or, if you’re American, try English.”

A public furor ensued, led by the Mexican-born actress Salma Hayek, who appeared on the magazine’s cover that month. Vanity Fair discontinued Dame Edna’s column not long afterward.

In an interview with The Times in 2004, Mr. Humphries was unrepentant.

“The people I offended were minorities with no sense of humor, I fear,” he said. “When you have to explain the nature of satire to somebody, you’re fighting a losing battle.”

Mr. Humphries drew further ire after a 2016 interview with the British newspaper The Telegraph in which he denounced political correctness as a “new puritanism.” In the same interview, he described people who transition from male to female as “mutilated” men, and Caitlyn Jenner in particular as “a publicity-seeking ratbag.”

Sailing Above the Fray

Dame Edna, for her part, appeared to sail imperviously through. She returned to Broadway in 2004 for the well-received show “Dame Edna: Back With a Vengeance” and in 2010 with “All About Me,” a revue that also starred the singer and pianist Michael Feinstein.

As herself — it was she, and not Mr. Humphries, who was credited — Dame Edna played the recurring character Claire Otoms (the name is an anagram for “a sitcom role”), an outré lawyer, on the Fox TV series “Ally McBeal.”

Under his own name, Mr. Humphries appeared as the Great Goblin in “The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey” (2012); as the voice of Bruce, the great white shark, in “Finding Nemo” (2003); and in other pictures.

Mr. Humphries’s books include the memoirs “More Please” (1992) and “My Life as Me” (2002) and the novel “Women in the Background” (1995). He was named a Commander of the British Empire in 2007.

Dame Edna also wrote several books, among them “Dame Edna’s Bedside Companion” (1983) and the memoir “My Gorgeous Life” (1989).

Mr. Humphries’s first marriage, to Brenda Wright, ended in divorce, as did his second, to Rosalind Tong, and his third, to Diane Millstead. He had two daughters, Tessa and Emily, from his marriage to Ms. Tong, and two sons, Oscar and Rupert, from his marriage to Ms. Millstead.

The Sydney Morning Herald reported that his survivors include his wife of 30 years, Lizzie Spender, the daughter of the British poet Stephen Spender, as well as his children and 10 grandchildren.

Mr. Humphries continued to perform until last year, when he toured Britain (as himself) with a one-man show, “The Man Behind the Mask.” He returned to Australia in December for Christmas.

Dame Edna’s husband, Norm, a chronic invalid “whose prostate,” she often lamented, “has been hanging over me for years,” died long ago. Her survivors include an adored son, Kenny, who designed all her gowns; a less adored son, Bruce; and a despised daughter, the wayward Valmai. (“She steals things. Puts them in her pantyhose. Particularly frozen chickens when she’s in a supermarket.”)

Another daughter, Lois, was abducted as an infant by a “rogue koala,” a subject Dame Edna could bring herself to discuss with interviewers only rarely.

Though the child was never seen again, to the end of her life Dame Edna never gave up hope she would be found.

“I’m looking,” she told NPR in 2015. “Every time I pass a eucalyptus tree I look up.”

Dear readers,

It was the day I found myself weeping over a purse during the final minutes of “Sex and the City 2,” miles above Omaha, that I came to truly believe in the powers of mild altitude hypoxia. This is, of course, the phenomenon in which the reduced rates of oxygen in flight may result in heightened emotional responses — and I love it. For those of us who find it hard to turn off our brains, whose entire viewing experience can be ruined by a single anachronism or grammatical error, who are tiresome even to ourselves — well, suspending that hectoring critic is a vacation in itself.

And it’s true for books, too! On a recent red-eye, it made sense to sob at the heart-rending conclusion of “Giovanni’s Room”; never has claustrophobia been more freeing than in James Baldwin’s precision-cut classic. But crying when Monroe Boston Strause finally hits upon the formula for chiffon filling in his 1939 memoir, “Pie Marches On”? It may have been cathartic, but it was time for a melatonin. (“Sex and the City 2” is, after all, frame for frame one of the worst movies ever made.)

These books hold up at any altitude.

This Portuguese family-saga-meets-coming-of-age-drama-meets-romance by one of the greatest of the 19th-century realists (just ask Zola!) is incredibly, improbably fun. José Maria de Eça de Queirós was prolific, and all of his work is characterized by a keen eye for human folly and material detail — but this novel is undoubtedly my favorite. Long? Yes, but it’s a page-turner. And Margaret Jull Costa’s 2007 translation renders it a pure bedtime pleasure, its heft a comfort rather than a burden.

As if the multigenerational story of shocking marriages, changing Lisbon mores, high-society affairs and arrogant young gentlemen getting taken down a few pegs were not enough, “The Maias” also features incredibly vivid descriptions of the era’s décor. To wit: “At the end of the corridor lay Alfonso’s study, furnished like a prelate’s chambers in red damasks. Everything in the room — the solid rosewood desk, the low shelves made from carved oak, the sober opulence of the bindings on the books — combined to create an austere air of studious peace, reinforced by a painting attributed to Rubens.”

Roffman’s was the first biography to look closely at the early life of the famously private Ashbery — who, according to conventional wisdom, made a point of avoiding the autobiographical in his poetry. This fluent, engrossing portrait makes a persuasive argument for the importance of youthful influences: the upstate farm and verdant landscape that show up, elliptically, in so much of the poet’s work; the books and music that introduced the precocious teenager to the larger world of art; the death of his beloved brother.

Roffman knew Ashbery, and had access to his childhood journals, his juvenilia and his Deerfield and college archives, so the result is intimate and detailed. She ends the book when Ashbery is in his late 20s and on the verge of success, but that gives us plenty of delicious glimpses into the electric early days of the New York School: his charismatic best friend Frank O’Hara, the surly Beats, the artists and dancers and avant-garde musicians, many of them queer, of bohemian New York — plus O’Hara’s weird Harvard roommate, the seemingly ubiquitous “Ted” Gorey.

It’s a must-read for Ashbery enthusiasts, but you don’t need to love or even like poetry to appreciate this story of growing up in an era when artistic potential felt limitless and the life of the mind was as vivid (almost) as that of Greenwich Village evenings.

Why don’t you …

Do a little spring cleaning? As a penniless young poet in 1970s New York, Bob Rosenthal signed on with a temp agency cleaning houses. But houses, of course, mean people. And people mean feelings, relationships, the unexpected. Rosenthal’s resulting book, “Cleaning Up New York,” is a deeply humane, often hilarious and ultimately moving little treatise on intimacy. As to cleaning tips? Dirt always wins.

Exercise your green thumb? I don’t remember how “The Flower Shop,” a photo book about the gorgeous Viennese florist Blumenkraft, came into my life. But it’s an idiosyncratic commentary on what the subtitle itself terms (endearingly) “charm, grace, beauty, tenderness in a commercial context.” Think of it as a documentary in book form: a glimpse into the life of a business and the people who have devoted their lives to it.

Pull yourself together, damn it? From the legendary grande dame decorator Dorothy Draper — whom one suspects subscribed to the “brisk walk” school of therapeutic treatment — comes a quote I have pinned above my desk for those many days when I’m tempted to be antisocial: “‘The Will to be Dreary’ is a morose little imp which whispers to us that something which we know would be fun would be too much trouble, will take too much time, is too expensive and probably wouldn’t be as amusing after all as just now you think it would be. Now don’t listen to that voice. Tune it out.”

    "7" : """ The Irish podcaster David Chambers spends his days‌ in an exceptionally drab office. A room so drab it is striking. In a recent interview via Zoom, he was dressed to match, in a white T-shirt and plain black hoodie. The only noteworthy thing onscreen was ‌an orange and white plastic bag that Chambers wore over his head. His green eyes, thick eyebrows‌ and beard could be seen through the bag’s holes, but the rest of his face was obscured.

Although they don’t know what he looks like underneath the mask, most people in Ireland know Chambers, 37, by his pseudonym “Blindboy Boatclub,” or, more often, just “Blindboy.” He is best known as the host of “The Blindboy Podcast,” a weekly show in which he discusses eclectic topics, like the unlikely benefits of lion urine or the link between heavy metal and futurism, and tells personal anecdotes that unspool like short stories. He addresses topics like mental health that Irish news media outlets rarely touch, and brings a millennial sensibility to political discussions. His register is earnest and intellectual, but also funny and down-to-earth.

“The Blindboy Podcast,” which Chambers started in 2017, regularly attracts 700,000 to one million monthly listeners, according to Acast, the company that hosts it. Six years on, it is something of a cultural phenomenon in Ireland, and increasingly overseas. Chambers has appeared on some of Ireland’s most popular television chat shows, and President Michael D. Higgins was a guest on a recent podcast episode. Acast says that more than half of the podcast’s listeners are outside Ireland, and Chambers has toured live shows in Canada, Thailand, Spain and Belgium.

Before the podcast, Chambers’s career took several surprising turns. He first used the alias “Blindboy” while making prank calls to radio call-in shows, which earned him some notoriety in Ireland and a cult following there. With a friend and fellow prank caller, Chambers formed a comedy hip-hop duo called the Rubberbandits that had a viral hit in 2010. That track, “Horse Outside,” reached No. 2 in the Irish charts, and Chambers maneuvered that success into hosting comedy shows on MTV and the British station Channel 4.

The plastic bag on Chambers’s head, which dates back to the beginning, was “part of a performance to challenge solemnity in whatever I do,” he said. But it also guarantees anonymity: He is grateful to be spared some of the trappings of fame, particularly in a small country, he said.

“Being an Irish celebrity in itself is a bit cringe — unless you’re Paul Mescal, like, a proper celebrity,” he said. “I don’t want that level of cringe. Being Blindboy in real life would be a very, very cringe existence.”

Anonymity also affords ‌Chambers ‌the freedom to talk candidly on the podcast about his personal struggles with mental health. He tells funny, relatable anecdotes about his experiences with, and efforts to manage, depression, anxiety and agoraphobia. One such episode is titled “Why I’m Going Back to Therapy.”

This openness resonates with his mostly millennial and Gen Z audience. Leah Moloney, a 27-year-old Irish fan who started listening regularly during the pandemic, said in an interview that she found the mental health content “really helpful at that time, because he was speaking really openly, and I certainly felt less alone.”

She added that when Chambers told listeners last April, in an episode called “Intrapersonally Speaking,” that he had been diagnosed with autism, that had helped her adapt to an A.D.H.D. diagnosis she had recently received. “I’ve been inspired by him to be open,” she said, adding that she now posts regularly about her experience of A.D.H.D. on TikTok.

Issues like these are still relatively under-discussed in the Irish news media and society, and Chambers’s fans seem to welcome his candor. He gets “thousands and thousands” of social media messages about mental health, he said, but he could never deal with interactions like those in person. “If I didn’t have the bag,” Chambers said, “I’d stop talking about mental health‌.”

On other episodes, Chambers talks frankly about an economic climate that he says has infantilized his generation. Ireland is in the grips of a rental crisis caused by a severe housing shortage; Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said last month that the country of five million people had 250,000 too few homes. And it is Ireland’s millennials who are worst affected, Chambers said. “The media will call a 40-year-old a young person. I’m in my late 30s and I refuse: I’m middle-aged,” he added. “If you call it ‘middle-aged people can’t get housing,’ it’s obvious there is a problem.”

Chambers said he saw a generational divide, too, in the way that the news media in the Republic of Ireland talks about Northern Irish politics. On the podcast, Chambers addresses millennial perspectives that he says news outlets in the South fail to reflect.

Sinn Fein, a political party that fields candidates on both sides of the border, has had a recent resurgence of popularity in the South, where it was once unpopular because it was associated with the Irish Republican Army. Chambers said the Irish news media continued to draw links between the party and terrorism. But for people born after the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that brokered peace in the North, he said, Sinn Fein lawmakers were “the ones who are doing something different.” (He added that he did not endorse any political parties.)

Several popular Instagram accounts attest to this growing interest in Northern Irish politics among young people in the Republic. One of these, called Tanistry, posts plainly illustrated slides explaining historical events such as the Good Friday Agreement, or the Bloody Sunday massacre of 1972, and relating them to contemporary politics. Andrew Clarke, a 27-year-old college student from Belfast who runs the account, said that there had been a culture of “mystification” around Northern Irish politics and that he was “trying to make it digestible,” adding that more than half of the account’s followers were aged 24 to 35, with the highest concentrations in Dublin and Belfast.

The most interesting thing about the success of “The Blindboy Podcast,” though, is the esoteric and seemingly random nature of many episodes. Where it is common for popular millennial podcasts to attract interest via culture war topics — deliberately courting controversy, or talking mostly about trending social justice issues — Chambers has garnered a huge audience mostly by talking about things that nobody is really supposed to care about.

One episode traces the history of offices back to monks; many others address arcane elements of Irish mythology. “Topographia Hibernica,” a short story collection by Chambers that will be published in Ireland and Britain in November, explores these themes further, looking at the links between mythology and colonialism.

Talking to him can feel like skittering around a galaxy of Wikipedia wormholes (in a good way). There is an infectious quality to his enthusiasm for a seemingly endless, and frequently bizarre, catalog of interests and passions.

Chambers said he put the success of “The Blindboy Podcast” down to the fact he only ever talks about his genuine interests, something he thinks the audience can sense. “I’ll never speak about something just to get listens,” he said.

    "8" : """ Two years into a surge of book bans across the United States, Florida is a hot spot in the clash over what reading material is appropriate for children, with laws that have greatly expanded the state’s ability to restrict books.

Historically, books were challenged one at a time. As bans in schools and libraries began increasing nationally in 2021, efforts were largely local, led by a parent or a group. But over the past year, access to books, particularly those touching on race, gender or sexual orientation, became increasingly politicized. With that came an increase in legislation and regulations in some states and school districts that affected which books libraries could offer.

The shift is particularly evident in Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican-controlled Legislature and a rapidly growing network of conservative groups aligned to pass three state laws last year aimed, at least in part, at reading or educational materials. Among the books removed from circulation in one of the state’s school districts are Toni Morrison’s “Beloved,” and Margaret Atwood’s “The Handmaid’s Tale.”

The policies have energized Mr. DeSantis’s supporters and are part of the platform from which he is expected to run for president.
Proponents of the restrictions say their aims are to protect students from inappropriate materials and to give parents more control over their children’s education. In focusing on “parents’ rights,” Mr. DeSantis is trying to build on the popularity he amassed when he resisted Covid-19 restrictions, particularly in schools. The push is a signature part of the conservatism he is showcasing in Florida. His Parental Rights in Education law, for example, constrains instruction on gender and sexuality, which has led some districts to remove books with L.G.B.T.Q. characters.

Some teachers and librarians say the policies are vague, with imprecise language and broad requirements, leading to some confusion. But they are trying to comply. Violation of the law could be a third-degree felony; in general, such crimes are punishable by up to five years in prison

In January, when the new guidelines went into effect, some teachers removed or covered up books that had not been vetted by certified media specialists, whose approval is now legally required. Others are not ordering titles that could draw complaints. Some educators emptied shelves or pulled collections until the titles could be reassessed.

“It is a whole new level of fear,” said Kathleen Daniels, the president of the Florida Association for Media in Education, a professional organization for school librarians and media educators. “There are books that are not being selected because they have been challenged.”

Florida ranks second, behind Texas, as the state with the highest number of book removals, according to a report released on Thursday from the free-speech organization PEN America, which tracked book bans in schools from July 1 to Dec. 31 of 2022. But PEN said that Florida’s broad, state-level approach, with “wholesale bans” that restrict access to “untold numbers of books in classrooms and school libraries,” made the true extent of book removals in the state difficult to quantify.

Many of the new restrictions come from a law passed last year that requires trained media specialists to evaluate each school book to ensure it is age-appropriate and free of “pornographic” content. The law also requires schools to keep a searchable online database of the books in their libraries and classrooms.

Proposed legislation goes further. In March, the Florida House passed a bill that could require schools to remove a book promptly based on a single complaint from a parent or county resident that the book depicted sexual conduct. Under the proposed bill, the book would remain unavailable until the complaint was resolved.

Two other laws are contributing to book bans in Florida schools. The Stop WOKE Act prohibits instruction that could make students feel guilty or responsible for the past actions of other members of their race. The Parents Rights in Education law prohibits classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in some elementary grades; a state rule is expected to expand the restrictions through 12th grade.

Efforts by Florida’s 67 public school districts to put the new regulations into practice have been uneven and often chaotic. Some districts have taken no major action. Others enacted blanket removals that essentially gutted libraries.

Earlier this year, soon after the new guidelines for libraries were issued in January, some districts moved quickly to comply. In Duval County, home to Jacksonville, the public school district restricted access to more than a million titles, keeping them out of students’ hands until they were vetted by specialists. In Manatee County, on Florida’s Gulf Coast, some teachers boxed up their classroom libraries or covered their shelves. Officials in Martin County, on the state’s Atlantic Coast, removed around 150 books from school circulation in January and February, including John Green’s “Looking for Alaska,” and James Patterson’s “Maximum Ride,” a series of sci-fi adventure books for readers ages 10 and up, which were pulled from elementary schools.

Mr. Patterson, who lives in Palm Beach, Fla., called the removal of his books “frightening.”

“When you can take a mainstream series like ‘Maximum Ride’ and take it off the shelves,” he said, “it shows that no one is safe.” A county spreadsheet gave no specific reason for the series’ removal.

Training material advised media specialists to consider how they would feel reading passages from the book in question aloud. “If you would not be comfortable reading the material in a public setting,” said a slide show by the state’s Department of Education, “then you should lean towards not making the material available in a school library for children.”

Jennifer Pippin leads a local chapter of the group Moms for Liberty in Florida and was on the Department of Education panel that helped design the training materials. She said books that had been removed from school libraries in the state should not be considered “banned” because they remained available at public libraries and in bookstores.

Young people in a school library might happen to pick up a book that contains a graphic rape scene, she said, because they enjoyed other volumes in the same series. Or a child interested in penguins might open a book about a penguin family with two dads. But “it may not be appropriate for them per their parents’ standards,” she said. “With no instruction or parental guidance, some of these things could indeed be harmful.”

In Duval County, the school district asked the district’s 54 media specialists in January to begin reviewing the more than 1.6 million titles. Unapproved books, elementary teachers were told, had to be covered or set aside.

About 25,000 books had cleared the review process as of early this month. The ongoing process has left Duval County’s more than 129,000 students with access to only a tiny fraction of available titles, critics said.

“Our books are being shadow-banned,” said Nina Perez, a Jacksonville resident and a director for MomsRising, an advocacy organization opposing the restrictions. “They get mired in an administrative process.”
Tracy Pierce, a Duval school district spokesman, said in an email last month that the actions had followed guidance from the state’s Department of Education. At no time should classrooms have been without reading material, he said, since students still had access to approved books and collections. He acknowledged that “a small number of principals did close or overly restrict” media centers briefly and were advised to restore access.

Mr. DeSantis has reacted aggressively to criticism that public schools are banning books. He dismissed news reports that Duval County schools had removed a title about the baseball player Roberto Clemente as “a joke,” accusing critics of “manufacturing” a narrative about book bans.

The book, which addresses the racism that Mr. Clemente faced, was removed and then restored in February after a review. Last month, the state’s education commissioner named the title, “Roberto Clemente: Pride of the Pittsburgh Pirates” by Jonah Winter, a book of the month for third through fifth grades.

At a news conference last month, Mr. DeSantis stood behind a sign that read “Exposing the Book Ban HOAX” and said that the state was trying to protect children from pornographic material. The event began with a presentation on books reported to districts for removal — including “Gender Queer,” by Maia Kobabe and “Flamer,” by Mike Curato — and highlighted scenes about sexual contact and masturbation.

“This idea of a book ban in Florida, that somehow they don’t want books in the library — that’s a hoax,” Mr. DeSantis said. “And that’s really a nasty hoax, because it’s a hoax in service of trying to pollute and sexualize our children.”

Critics in the state are pushing back. In March, Democracy Forward, an advocacy organization, filed a lawsuit with the state on behalf of the Florida Education Association and other groups challenging the rules, arguing that they censor educators, limit students’ access to books and harm public education. The Florida Freedom to Read Project organized a rally in Tallahassee last month with authors and free speech activists to protest censorship.

After Brian Covey, a substitute teacher in Jacksonville, posted a video in January of empty library shelves at a Duval County middle school, a reporter asked Mr. DeSantis about it. The governor called the video a “fake narrative.” Mr. Covey, who lost his job shortly after, said that he was troubled that Mr. DeSantis and the school district tried to delegitimize what he had documented.

The fact that they called it a false narrative, Mr. Covey said, “tells me that they have no intention of saying, ‘We made a mistake.’”

    "9" : """ Lucinda Williams, the Grammy-winning 70-year-old songwriter, was born in Lake Charles, La. Her grandfathers were both preachers; one was a civil rights advocate. Her father, Miller Williams, was an award-winning poet. Her mother loved music and played the piano. Williams grew up in Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, Utah, Chile and Mexico. On paper, it was an ideal upbringing for the artist she became: a nomadic touring musician whose songs draw on deep Southern roots, using matter-of-fact imagery to conjure tempestuous emotions.

But her pedigree didn’t make her life fall neatly into place, as Williams recalls in her memoir, “Don’t Tell Anybody the Secrets I Told You.” “I’ve held back from talking about my childhood over the decades of my life,” she notes. “I’ve written songs about it instead.”

Williams’s mother was sexually abused as a child, she writes, and lived with schizophrenia and alcoholism. Her poet-professor father was a mentor and protector, but he also had a temper. Williams’s parents divorced after her father took up with one of his teenage students.

In the title song of her best-selling album, “Car Wheels on a Gravel Road,” Williams sings about being a “Child in the back seat ’bout four or five years/Lookin’ out the window, little bit of dirt mixed with tears.” When her father first heard it, he told Williams that she was that crying little girl; until then, Williams hadn’t realized she was writing about herself.

Williams’s memoir is as flinty, earthy and plain-spoken as her songs. She reveals the autobiographical underpinnings of some of her darkest lyrics, but she also tells a larger tale: of artistic determination battling personal insecurity; of misjudging and being misjudged by men and by the music business; and of steadfastly holding her own.

She doesn’t give in: not on a trendy remix, not on her album cover photos, not on her instincts. She can handle being called difficult or “insane” even though, she admits, “There are times when I can bring an extra layer of unpredictable emotion to a situation that is already tough to begin with.” The lasting results are in her songs.

Williams envisioned life as a musician soon after she picked up a guitar. She started performing folk songs in her teens. But even as she honed her own songwriting and built local reputations — in Texas and then in Los Angeles — she worked day jobs well into her 30s. Major labels rejected her, again and again, as being “too country for rock” but “too rock for country.”

From the beginning — two low-budget Folkways albums she made in 1979 and 1980 — Williams sang about elemental subjects: desire, sorrow, love, traveling, survival, death. Some of her songs are kiss-offs; some offer regrets; some are elegies; some are takedowns. They’re always grounded in homely details. In “Hot Blood,” a bluesy outpouring of female lust, she sings about feeling “a cold chill” as she watches a guy just “fixin’ your flat with a tire iron.”

It took an English punk label, Rough Trade, to release “Lucinda Williams,” her 1988 breakthrough album. A decade later, “Car Wheels on a Gravel Road” marked her commercial peak. But recording that album, she recalls in the memoir, was lengthy and fraught. Making records, she writes, “can test the limits and boundaries of everyone involved. I now understand that is normal.”

Getting the sound Williams wanted on “Car Wheels” led to the breakup of her longtime band and clashes with two producers. Then contractual tangles delayed the release of the finished album for two years. Williams also nixed a video concept from the director Paul Schrader, deciding, “He was just another guy trying to impose his vision on a female artist. ‘Car Wheels’ did fine without a video.”

Throughout her book, Williams recognizes her own appetites and mistakes. She writes about suffering from obsessive-compulsive disorder and bouts of depression, and she recognizes her weakness for the kind of boyfriend she calls “a poet on a motorcycle,” guys who often turned out to be cheaters, addicts or worse.

She came through anyway. “That relationship was done, but I got a good song out of it,” she writes about one romantic debacle. Williams has been married since 2009 to her manager, producer and songwriting collaborator, Tom Overby.

Although Williams finished her book in 2022, it doesn’t mention her 2020 stroke; she can no longer play guitar. But she returned to touring in 2021 and persists in writing songs; she’s releasing a new album in June. Her memoir shows how deep that grit runs.

    "11" : """ Onstage at Webster Hall in New York last fall, Jessie Ware glided through choreography in a faux-fur-trimmed turquoise caftan, and later swung a black whip while singing the title track from her 2020 disco LP, “What’s Your Pleasure?” Backstage, however, was a different vibe.

“I had a bat mitzvah lesson in my dressing room,” the British singer and songwriter, 38, said in an interview last month. “That’s when your worlds are colliding.”

Ware has become an expert at hilariously exposing the gap between the luxuriousness of her music and the realities of life as a touring musician, a mother of three young children, a cookbook author and a successful podcaster (“Table Manners,” co-hosted by her mother, Lennie, is in its 15th season).

“What’s Your Pleasure?,” an album designed for escape, gave her music career a jolt. Her fifth LP — “That! Feels Good!,” out Friday — is a sequel of sorts, but the earlier album’s synth thump is joined by a new dimension: soulful, brassy warmth, often thanks to Kokoroko, an eight-piece band. “I’ve always longed to make soul music,” Ware said. “I’ve done bits and bobs of it, but this felt very focused and authentic.”
Scrolling through a list of cultural influences on her phone in the bar of a New York hotel, Ware debated what to include. “You think Fran Lebowitz would be my friend if I put her in the Top 10?” she asked, before deciding, “She wouldn’t want to be my friend because I’m on my phone too much.” These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

Photo Booths

I’m constantly trying to make my phone take pictures that look old and romantic, and the photo booth just does that. And also the fact that you can’t change it — I like that, and that they’re these four pictures that can take you back to a nostalgic moment. My husband did a photography degree but he’s [expletive] at taking photos of me: terrible angles, manages to always take them when my eyes are half open. What I’ve just started doing is taking selfies of myself, but pretending that I’m being caught off guard so that I can get really good photos with my children.

‘The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills’

It’s dirty and naughty and I probably should be doing something else, but I’m there, invested in the Kathy and Kyle drama. And I love it. It centers me. And my husband walks in and he’s like, What are you watching? And I’m like, Don’t judge me, these are really important women that are telling very important stories and they’re very entertaining. I love Mauricio. I live for the moments when he’s stoned. Dorit has really grown on me, I think she’s got real wit. I really miss Lisa Vanderpump. I loved her.

Eggs

Because they’re versatile. Because you can have them at any meal. Because I wrote a book called “Omelet.” They solve a lot of problems. I feel at home with an egg anywhere. I said this in my book, but if there was a crisis, my mum would be like, “Do you want an omelet, darling?” So it became like this thing where like my brother was like, I don’t want a [expletive] omelet.

My Saved Places on Google Maps

I hate missing out on good food in a new place. It’s kind of slightly stressful. When we were on holiday for our honeymoon, I wasn’t a bridezilla, I was a honeymoonzilla. But I didn’t have the Google Maps saved lists that could have made my life easier. So when I’m on tour, I save places that people recommend. It’s so good for being able to work out your route for the day, like, I’m going to go to this coffee shop, then I’m going to go to the famous cemetery in Buenos Aires, and then I’m going to walk from there.

Matinees

Jamie Lee Curtis said that whole thing about like, Why doesn’t Coldplay do a matinee? I completely agree with her. Apparently Little Mix have always been doing matinees. Much respect to them. The idea of going onstage at 9 p.m. sometimes fills me with total dread, when I’m usually in my pajamas watching “Real Housewives” or something. Can you call a lunch a matinee? Anything that’s, like, in the day. Then you have time to digest it, understand it, enjoy it. But also time for that eight hours sleep.

6
Handwritten Letters

I don’t do it enough, but I appreciate them so much. And handwritten cards. Emails, I’m over it, I know that that’s how we function. Text messages, I get it. But there’s nothing more thoughtful than a handwritten letter. I think I read that Reese Witherspoon did this, but I write my children a letter every year. They’ve all got their own book, and I write them a letter, mainly so I can remember what they did in the year. Because I know that when they get to like, 21, then they’re going to ask me and I’ll be like, I don’t know what your first word was.

7
Musicals

It’s kind of where I began singing. It’s something that’s really inspired how I make music — that idea of escapism and the idea of melodrama combined with emotion. I like that fantasy aspect of it, that it can kind of elevate. If you say you hate musical theater, I’m going to question our friendship, because I don’t believe that you’ve gone to see good enough musical theater.

8
‘The Traitors’

I’m talking about the first season of the British series. If anybody played the game at university called Mafia, where you have to say who the killer is and they have to kill other people whilst you’re like, staring? The premise is that, and we would all be very rich if whilst we were getting stoned at uni, we thought that could be a great format for television.

Foreign Pharmacies

There was a time when you could get Valium in India when I was in my 20s. That was a fantastic time. But also for the products, particularly in the French pharmacies, the beauty products. I mean, you can now get Bioderma everywhere now, but there was a time where everybody would come back from Fashion Week with loads of Bioderma. I love perusing the aisles of a foreign pharmacy and getting any kind of insect repellent, sunglasses, chewing gum.

Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge, or the Knockoff

I got it for my husband for Christmas, but I wear it. It’s obscenely expensive. One day my beautician came ’round to give me a wax, and I said, “You smell really good!” She went, “Oh babe, I got it in Zara.” I was like, You’re kidding me. Zara has done a knockoff, so you don’t need to spend the bloody amount of money that I did. It smelled exactly the same.

    "12" : """ Alec Baldwin was mounted on a chestnut horse in a steep gully in a snow-dusted valley in Montana on Friday, his first day back filming “Rust,” the western whose cinematographer was shot and killed in 2021 when a gun he was practicing with on its set went off.

“Set, ready, and … action,” cried Gerard DiNardi, the movie’s new first assistant director, and Mr. Baldwin urged the horse forward, toward a camera rigged on a pickup truck.

As Mr. Baldwin returned to the set of “Rust,” prosecutors in New Mexico filed court papers formally dismissing, at least for now, the involuntary manslaughter charges he had been facing in the shooting of the film’s original cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins, who was killed outside Santa Fe, where the movie was initially filmed.

The prosecutors, Jason Lewis and Kari Morrissey, wrote in their filing in the case of the State of New Mexico vs. Alexander Rae Baldwin III that they were withdrawing the charges against him “since new facts were revealed that demand further investigation and forensic analysis” that could not be completed before a hearing, set to begin on May 3, at which a judge was to rule on whether the charges against Mr. Baldwin could proceed.

But the prosecutors held out the possibility that new charges against Mr. Baldwin could still be filed, writing that “the investigation is active and on-going.”

The prosecutors dropped the charges after receiving new evidence suggesting that the gun Mr. Baldwin had been practicing with when it fired the bullet that killed Ms. Hutchins had been modified without his knowledge, according to an official close to the investigation who was granted anonymity to discuss the case.

The new evidence cast doubt on the prosecution’s argument that Mr. Baldwin must have pulled the trigger, the official said. Mr. Baldwin, who was told the day of the shooting that the gun he was practicing with did not contain any live ammunition, has denied pulling the trigger, saying the gun fired after he had pulled its hammer back and let it go.

Seth Kenney, the owner of PDQ Arm & Prop, an Albuquerque company that was the primary supplier of guns to the production, said that he had not modified any of the guns he supplied for “Rust” and had no reason to, because all of them already functioned smoothly.

“The guns were not modified,” he said in an interview on Friday. “They were brand-new and in perfect working order.”

Mr. Baldwin, 65, has maintained that he was not responsible for the fatal shooting, which took place on Oct. 21, 2021, on a church set on a ranch outside Santa Fe. He has sued several people associated with the film, including the movie’s original first assistant director and its armorer, accusing them of negligence for giving him a loaded gun on the set that fired. The original first assistant director, Dave Halls, reached a plea deal with prosecutors and was sentenced to six months of probation.

The film’s original armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who loaded the gun that day and was responsible for weapons and ammunition on the set, still faces involuntary manslaughter charges. She had also originally faced a preliminary hearing on the charges in May, but on Friday Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer agreed to delay it until Aug. 9, in part so that prosecutors could subpoena witnesses in their investigation.

Mr. Baldwin still faces several civil suits. Gloria Allred, a lawyer representing Mamie Mitchell, the former script supervisor for “Rust,” and Ms. Hutchins’s parents and sister, said in a statement on Friday that “we remain committed to fighting and winning for our clients and holding him accountable for pointing a loaded gun at Halyna Hutchins, pulling the trigger and killing her.”

“He can run to Montana and pretend that he is just an actor in a wild west movie,” she said in the statement, “but, in real life, he cannot escape from the fact that he had a major role in a tragedy which had real-life consequences for Halyna, her mother, father, sister and co-worker.” Mr. Baldwin has denied the claims in the civil suits against him.

The revived production of “Rust” is going ahead with the support of Ms. Hutchins’s widower, Matthew Hutchins, who was named an executive producer.

After New Mexico’s Occupational Health and Safety Bureau found that the company had demonstrated “plain indifference to the recognized hazards associated with the use of firearms on set,” the company behind the movie, Rust Movie Productions, agreed this year to pay a $100,000 settlement, which included a downgraded citation.

As filmmakers returned to finish the movie more than a year after the killing of Ms. Hutchins had shut down the film, they moved the production here to Montana, to a film set just north of Yellowstone National Park. Joel Souza, who was also struck by the bullet that killed Ms. Hutchins, was back in the director’s chair. He said in a statement that his “every effort on this film will be devoted to honoring Halyna’s legacy and making her proud.”

At the new location, Mr. Baldwin had gotten back into character as Harland Rust, a notorious outlaw who helps his grandson escape the death penalty, fleeing with him on horseback.

As filming resumed, and a light snow fell on the shrub land, the film’s newly hired armorer, Andrew Wert, adjusted the leather bandolier fitted onto the actor. Placed inside was what appeared to be ammunition for a .45 Long Colt. The bullets were rubber.

    "13" : """ The creator and two stars of the new Netflix series “Beef” addressed a brewing controversy on Friday about another actor on the show who said on a podcast in 2014 that he had sexually assaulted a masseuse, comments now recirculating on social media.

David Choe, an actor and artist, has long said that he made up the incident he recounted on his podcast, an assertion that the show’s creator, Lee Sung Jin, and its lead actors, Steven Yeun and Ali Wong, backed up in a statement.

“The story David Choe fabricated nine years ago is undeniably hurtful and extremely disturbing,” said Lee, Yeun and Wong, who are also executive producers on “Beef.” “We do not condone this story in any way, and we understand why this has been so upsetting and triggering.”

They added, “We’re aware David has apologized in the past for making up this horrific story, and we’ve seen him put in the work to get the mental health support he needed over the last decade to better himself and learn from his mistakes.”

Netflix confirmed the authenticity of the statement, which was made exclusively to Vanity Fair, but declined to comment. Choe and representatives for Lee, Yeun and Wong did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

On a 2014 episode of a podcast that Choe co-hosted, he talked about engaging in what he called “rape-y behavior” when he coerced a masseuse into oral sex. He later said that the story was made up.

“I never raped anyone,” he told The New York Times two years ago.

The clip from his podcast has recirculated on social media since the premiere of “Beef” this month. The show stars Yeun and Wong as Angelenos who get into a road-rage conflict that ripples into the rest of their lives, and Choe appears in seven episodes as the cousin of Yeun’s character.

The 10-episode season has received praise from critics and was the service’s second-most-watched English-language show this week, according to Netflix.

Choe hosted a four-episode limited series on FX and Hulu in 2021 and has appeared in other shows sporadically, including in one episode of “The Mandalorian.” “Beef” is his first substantial acting role.

Choe gained broad recognition in 2012, after an initial public offering appeared to make him a multimillionaire.

Several years earlier, the entrepreneur Sean Parker had asked Choe to paint murals in the Palo Alto, Calif., offices of an internet start-up. Parker offered him $60,000 or stock in the nascent company, Choe has said, which is how Choe wound up a very early shareholder in Facebook, which is now called Meta.

    "14" : """ Valda Setterfield, a leading figure in the New York dance world for 60 years and the wife and muse of the renowned choreographer David Gordon, died on April 9 in Manhattan. She was 88.

Alyce Dissette, the producing director of the Pick Up Performance Company, which Mr. Gordon founded in 1971, said Ms. Setterfield died in her sleep in a hospital, which she had entered a week earlier with pneumonia.

In a career that took her from the Russian dancer and teacher Tamara Karsavina in the 1950s to Woody Allen in the 1990s, Ms. Setterfield was often Mr. Gordon’s onstage partner, an association that began before their marriage in 1961 and lasted until their 2018 season at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Her ties with Merce Cunningham, as a dancer in his company, a teacher of his technique and one of his trusted friends, endured for decades.

Ms. Setterfield had a singularly theatrical presence onstage, and often offstage as well, dressing imaginatively in clothes she had assembled from thrift shops. That theatricality was heightened by her impeccable diction and her low, melodious speaking voice. She and Mr. Gordon were once called “the Barrymores of postmodern dance.”

Valda Setterfield was born on Sept. 17, 1934, in Margate, England, in the county of Kent, and grew up in the Kent town of Birchington-on-Sea. She was the only child of Eileen (Walker) Setterfield, a homemaker, and Thomas Valentine Setterfield, who went from venture to venture professionally.

Her passion for dance, which she discovered when she was about 4, took her to London, where she studied with Marie Rambert and Ms. Karsavina. She watched the foremost dancers of the day at Covent Garden and other theaters, forming a particular devotion to Margot Fonteyn.

When Ms. Setterfield was in her early 20s, she met the critic and performer David Vaughan, an Englishman with an eclectic taste in dance forms who had moved to New York in 1950. He became a lifelong friend. “You know,” she later recalled him telling her, “they have very interesting ideas in New York that we don’t have.”

Following his suggestion, Ms. Setterfield tried New York, arriving with a scholarship from the choreographer José Limón. Soon she was studying with Merce Cunningham and James Waring. It was in these circles that she met David Gordon, an intellectually curious young New Yorker who was already performing for Mr. Waring.

Mr. Cunningham was not yet a celebrity. Still, just watching him teach class, Ms. Setterfield told The Guardian in 2019, she thought, “This is why I came to America!” His class, she said, “had an anatomical sense to it — it went into an amazing range of shapes and steps, as well as the most thrilling rhythmic combinations.” Mr. Cunningham, she recalled, said to her, “Don’t make everything so pretty,” an observation she found revelatory.

Mr. Waring’s work often seemed small-scale, but it opened many doors in its striking blurring of the distinctions between art and life, its cultivation of a form of theatricality sometimes labeled camp, and its study of nonvirtuoso forms of movement.

In the early 1960s, Ms. Setterfield and Mr. Gordon found themselves well aligned for the dance experimentalism that took off at the Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village. The dancers and choreographers Yvonne Rainer and Trisha Brown were among their most valued colleagues. In due course, Mr. Gordon and Ms. Setterfield moved into a loft in the same Lower Broadway building where Ms. Brown and two other choreographers, Lucinda Childs and Douglas Dunn, lived.

During these years, Ms. Setterfield often played nondance roles for visiting dance companies at the Metropolitan Opera House. Decades later, she would speak in awe of sharing the stage with Ms. Fonteyn in “The Sleeping Beauty” and the Bolshoi’s Galina Ulanova in “Romeo and Juliet.”

Mr. Cunningham engaged Ms. Setterfield briefly in 1961, the year she married Mr. Gordon. On Aug. 5 of that year, she was one of nine highly individual dancers cast in the world premiere of Mr. Cunningham’s “Aeon,” with a score by John Cage and designs by Robert Rauschenberg, neither yet the artistic celebrity he would become.

“Aeon,” which Mr. Cage described as “epic in character,” was 45 minutes long. It began with a series of small explosions, and its sequences could be performed so as to overlap. Mr. Rauschenberg, in those days the Cunningham company’s stage manager as well as its chief designer, devised a machine that crossed the stage on a rope.

At the Judson Church, Ms. Setterfield danced in works by Ms. Rainer, Mr. Gordon and others. Here, pedestrian movement was OK; improvisation was OK; minimalism was OK. And, although Ms. Rainer famously announced “No to theatricality,” it would have been truer to say that the Judson dance makers were continually re-exploring theatricality and redefining the nature of theater.

Ms. Setterfield combined these activities with motherhood. She left the Cunningham troupe when she and Mr. Gordon had a son, Ain, in 1962, but she was brought back in 1965 and stayed until 1975, creating roles in 13 Cunningham works. The sets were designed by, among others, Jasper Johns, Bruce Nauman and Frank Stella; the composers included John Cage, Toshi Ichiyanagi, Pauline Oliveros and David Tudor.

Mr. Gordon established the Pick Up Performance Company to make new dances in 1971. Three years later he created “Chair” for Ms. Setterfield and himself, which introduced a long series of works in which she was his partner, his muse or his protagonist. Those works were often about the connections and paradoxes between art and life.

In 1982, the couple were the subject of a long profile in The New Yorker written by the critic Arlene Croce. It was one of many signs that postmodern dance had graduated into the big leagues.

As the years passed, it pleased Mr. Gordon to find an ever more diverse array of roles for his wife.

In 1988, when he created “Mates” for Britain’s Rambert Dance Company, he gave her a role, thus linking her to the troupe’s founder, Marie Rambert, who had trained her more than 30 years before. Ms. Setterfield was the artist Marcel Duchamp in Mr. Gordon’s “The Mysteries and What’s So Funny” (1991), the Old Man and the Old Woman in his adaptation of Eugene Ionesco’s “The Chairs” (2004), and Bertolt Brecht in his “Uncivil Wars” (2006).

Ms. Setterfield also performed independently of Mr. Gordon, in acting as well as dancing roles. She had featured film roles in Brian De Palma’s “The Wedding Party” (1969) and Yvonne Rainer’s “Lives of Performers” (1972), and minor roles in two movies by Woody Allen, “Mighty Aphrodite” (1995) and “Everyone Says I Love You” (1996).

On television, she was seen in “Beyond the Mainstream” (1980), an episode of the PBS series “Dance in America.” In 1987, she co-starred with Mikhail Baryshnikov in “David Gordon’s Made in USA,” an installment of PBS’s “Great Performances.” And in 1992 she was a member of the White Oak Dance Project, the company founded by Mr. Baryshnikov.

From 1994 to 2013, Ms. Setterfield appeared with Paradigm, a collective led by her former Cunningham colleague Gus Solomons Jr.; in 2008, she performed in a work by a much younger Cunningham alumnus, Jonah Bokaer.

In 2009 and 2010, she performed in France and other countries, including the United States, with the French choreographer Boris Charmatz in a Cunningham-derived production. (“Would Merce be amused?” she wrote in an email at the time. “I like to think so. Into the unknown, integrity ahoy!”)

When Mr. Gordon’s “Live Archiveography” was presented at the Kitchen in Manhattan in 2017, Ms. Setterfield appeared on center stage, as she did in Mr. Gordon’s 2018 revival of his 1972 work “The Matter” at the Museum of Modern Art.

When she was in her 80s, she played the title role in “Lear,” created (after Shakespeare’s play) by the Irish choreographer John Scott, for which she won a Herald Angel Award at the 2016 Edinburgh Festival. Among her other honors were several New York Dance and Performance Awards, also known as the Bessie.

Ms. Setterfield collaborated a number of times with her son, Ain Gordon, notably in the Off Broadway play “The Family Business” (1995), which also included her husband, and for which all three won an Obie Award.

Mr. Gordon died in January 2022, the morning after he and Ms. Setterfield had celebrated their 61st wedding anniversary. She is survived by their son; his husband, the dancer and choreographer Wally Cardona (who performed with her at MoMA in “The Matter” revival); and two granddaughters.

“Rescued” is the first new song Foo Fighters have released since the sudden death of the band’s beloved drummer Taylor Hawkins in March 2022, and its lyrics seem to address that tragedy and the remaining members’ grief. “It happened so fast, and then it was over,” Dave Grohl sings before unleashing one of those signature screams that manages to be throat-lacerating and melodic: “Is this happening now?” Hawkins’s absence is a gaping void in “Rescued,” the first track from a June album, “But Here We Are.” But perhaps because of it, the Foos sound more focused than they have in a while, driven by a fresh sense of pathos and urgency.

Katie Gavin lets a missed connection know exactly what they’re missing on the bold and sassy “One That Got Away,” a new single the pop group Muna debuted last weekend at Coachella. “If you never put it on the line, how am I gonna sign for it?” Gavin sings on the synth-driven track, as the booming, echoing production serves to effectively amplify her feelings. ZOLADZ

“I know that everything is feeling like it’s falling apart all the time,” sings Lindsey Olsen, who records as Salami Rose Joe Louis, in “Dimcola Reprise” from her coming album, “Akousmatikous” (which means “sound where there is no identifiable source” in Greek). Most of the track is a busily looping, pattering, burbling electronic backdrop for her whispery voice, which eventually advises, “It’s gonna be OK/Just make it through the day.” But before it ends, the song pivots completely, turning to slow chromatic chords and suspended vocal harmonies — a brief moment of respite. JON PARELES

Aaron Jerome, the English electronic music producer who calls himself Sbtrkt and performs behind a mask, has been working over “L.F.O.” since 2018, apparently making it stranger with each iteration. It’s an ever-evolving succession of thick, harmonically ambiguous synthesizer chords, coalescing into a rhythm and pushing it aside, accelerating and falling apart and reconverging. The lyrics, delivered in Sampha’s eerie falsetto and George Riley’s confessional breathiness, offer paradoxes and self-questioning: “I’m changing, moving, losing, higher,” Riley sings. The song will be on Sbtrkt’s new album, “The Rat Road,” in May. Whatever the context, it’s likely to be destabilizing. PARELES

The Argentine singer Nathy Peluso enlisted the hitmaking producer Illangelo (the Weeknd, Post Malone) for the furious kiss-off “Tonta” (“Foolish”). A thumping, clattering beat propels her indictment of her ex from seething to sneering to a well-placed scream. She also shows some gleeful scorn as she overdubs her voice into a mocking horn section, trumpeting “tararatata” as she demolishes any hopes of reconciliation. PARELES

Bad Bunny, proudly from Puerto Rico, is determined to expand his music into a pan-Latin coalition. With “Un x100to” (“One Percent”), he joins Grupo Frontera, a Mexican-rooted norteño band from Texas, for a song about using the last 1 percent of his cellphone power to call an ex and confess that he misses her. Grupo Frontera’s section of the song is a traditional-flavored, accordion-backed cumbia. Bad Bunny arrives with a different, rap-informed melody over arena-scale electronic chords. But with Grupo Frontera working, he returns to the clip-clop beat and chorus of the cumbia — another strategic alliance certified. JON PARELES

“I thought that I was hungry for love,” Florence Welch sings at the beginning of a menacing new song, “Mermaids,” adding, “Maybe I was just hungry for blood.” The dark, brooding track sounds of a piece with “Dance Fever,” the group’s 2022 album that often found Welch threading her personal recollections and musings into a more mythical tapestry. That contrast emerges in the second movement of “Mermaids,” when Welch sings memorably about long nights of London debauchery and “hugging girls that smelt like Britney Spears and coconuts.” ZOLADZ

At Coachella and now online, Chris of Christine and the Queens has gone primal and musically skeletal. “I need you to love me,” he sings in “True Love,” over a blipping, tapping two-chord track, joined by 070 Shake, who sees “your dark eyes staring at me.” The song is measured and quantized, but thoroughly obsessional. PARELES

The latest cross-cultural foray by the banjoist Béla Fleck is a collaboration with the bassist Edgar Meyer and two Indian musicians: Zakir Hussain on tabla and Rakesh Chaurasia on bansuri (bamboo flute). For most of “Motion,” Fleck takes a supporting role behind rising, inquisitive melodies from the bass and bansuri as Hussain’s tabla stirs up a fluttering momentum. When banjo and bansuri share a melody in unison, the eerie timbre is an acoustic discovery. PARELES

    "16" : """ “Giving voice to our darkest thoughts is how we gain access to our deepest truths,” the true believer Lisa tells Adult Natalie as a prompt during one of Lottie’s workshops. Indeed, Lottie’s methodology is proven right over the course of the fifth episode of “Yellowjackets,” where destructive secrets are wantonly shared. But there is little healing to come from these confessions, only more destruction.

Take, for instance, Misty.

Teen Misty is feeling especially loose lipped thanks to her friendship with her “bestie” Crystal. Some facts we learn about Misty: The three famous people she would invite to a slumber party are Plato, the “Grind” host Eric Nies and Jack Kevorkian because what he does is “so brave.” She hates deodorant. She once walked in on her parents having sex and wasn’t all that grossed out. And, of course, the one we already know: She destroyed the plane’s emergency transmitter the night after the crash so she could remain the Yellowjackets’ hero in crisis.

That last one doesn’t sit well with Crystal, whose name, it turns out, is actually Kristen. That’s the kind of secret that she shared with Misty, explaining that she never corrected her teammates when they mistakenly called her “Crystal the pistol” on the first day of practice. It’s a detail about her life that she revels in sharing with her best friend, something sort of embarrassing but not actually all that shameful. Misty misreads Crystal’s acceptance. Rather than celebrate their shared oddity when Misty utters the story about the transmitter, Crystal’s expression drops. Misty is the reason they are all stranded. Suddenly the game isn’t fun.

Misty tries to save face, pretending she’s just kidding, but Crystal knows better. “You’re not that good of an actress,” she says. Misty, facing social isolation once more, resorts to a threat, vowing to kill Crystal if she tells anyone. She doesn’t have to. Crystal stumbles backward and plummets to her death. When Misty returns to the cabin, she tells the group Crystal got lost in the raging storm that just descended on the wilderness knowing full well Crystal’s mangled body is at the foot of a cliff.

In the present, Walter Tattersall also knows that Misty isn’t a very good actress. Their dynamic mirrors Misty and Crystal’s, though Misty isn’t as willing a participant in the banter he’s trying to start. She reluctantly plays his game of “two truths and a lie” before getting distracted upon finding the gate to Lottie’s compound. When Natalie emerges, it’s not the reunion for which Misty had hoped: Natalie sends the betrayed and frustrated Misty away.

What Misty fails to recognize is she finally has someone sitting across from her who will accept her strangeness wholeheartedly. Walter has figured out she was likely involved in Adam Martin’s death, but he doesn’t really care. “I like you regardless of your extracurricular activities,” he says.

He’s had his own odd experience with killers — his grandma murdered his grandfather, apparently — and is bizarrely charmed by Misty’s nefariousness. This isn’t the same situation as Shauna’s daughter, Callie, and the creepy cop who is trying to pry clues out of her through bowling dates. Unless I’m mistaking his earnestness for something else, Walter says what he means.

But Misty rejects that. She’s offended that he thinks she’s a murderer and fails to see that she might finally have a weirdo who matches her, a bestie who’s even more sympathetic than Crystal, may she rest in peace. Instead, she leaves Walter behind and marches up to Lottie’s community with a new plan: She’s going to join up.

In that enclave, Natalie has been trying to unearth some secrets of her own. She finally manages to dig around Lottie’s office, and discovers boxes of personal documents about Lottie’s followers. To her it looks like a gold mine, but she’s quickly shut down when it turns out everyone relinquished that information willingly.

With Natalie despondent, Lottie turns the tables on her, encouraging Natalie to divulge what she’s been hiding — specifically, what she told Travis that led to his death. Using a technique from her “time away” — a euphemistic term for when she was institutionalized — Lottie flashes a light in Natalie’s eyes and coaxes out of her the story of the last time she saw Travis.

It’s a seedy tale in which Natalie and Travis went on a bender and Natalie overdosed. In her unconscious state, Natalie saw a vision of the Yellowjackets’ crash site, but none of them had survived. The mysterious figure known as the “antler queen” moves through the vessel among the corpses. When Natalie was revived she told Travis: “I saw it. I felt it. We brought it back. Trav, we brought it back with us.”

As she shares this, Lottie, terrified, looks over her shoulder and sees the shadow of that same person or creature. “Yellowjackets” viewers have theorized that Lottie was the “antler queen” because she dons a crown made of antlers at the “Doomcoming.” But now Lottie is the one haunted by that image. Is it her own shadow self that’s scaring her? Or is the “antler queen” even a single being? Is it instead the manifestation of the “darkness” all of the Yellowjackets carry?

That darkness has arrived at Adult Van’s apartment-slash-video store in the form of Taissa. Tai is aware she is placing a huge burden on Van by asking for her help. Meanwhile, Van has some hidden habits of her own, squirreling away oxycodone when she thinks Tai is asleep. And Tai is asleep when Van takes the drug. It’s the “other one” — Tai’s alter ego — who emerges in the darkness and kisses Van. “This isn’t where we are supposed to be,” she says.

It’s easy to think of the spirits plaguing these women and girls as evil, yet in the final moments of the hour we’re given an example of wilderness mysticism as a force for good. Pregnant Shauna has grown understandably suspicious of Lottie, who whispers to her baby in utero. But when Shauna and Tai are stranded in heavy snowfall they are seemingly guided by Lottie’s mantras about hearing the wind and the trees. They are able to make it back as Shauna goes into labor, her primal scream of pain ending the episode.

In an earlier scene, Lottie had told the fetus, “You are going to change everything.” Now the child is here, a new life entering the world replacing Crystal, who has left it. Bye, bestie. Hello, baby.

More to chew on

Adult Shauna’s Built to Spill T-shirt is a great costuming choice.

An interesting fact for those keeping track of where everyone was post-rescue: Tai and Van were still together when Shauna got married. They swapped out the guest book pen for a dirty novelty pen.

I think the creepiest character on the show might be Matt Saracusa, the adult detective who pretends to date a teen to solve a case. In addition to its general ickiness, I grew tired of that whole plotline this episode including Shauna’s fake tryst with Randy, the most useless character on the show.

The motif of videotape static has been with the show since the beginning thanks to the opening credits, but it’s being deployed more and more in the narrative. What does it mean?

Is Misty actually a murderer? Technically, she isn’t as far as we know, and maybe that’s why she’s so angry at Walter’s assumption. She’s definitely an accessory and you could probably charge her with manslaughter. But straight up murder? Not yet.

Does Crystal become the next meal?

    "17" : """ The first thing we learn about Amanda (Rachael Leigh Cook) in “A Tourist’s Guide to Love” is that she works for a high-end agency called Tourista World Travel. But nobody in this Netflix film even comments on the fact that “turista” is slang for vacation-wrecking diarrhea. That puzzling choice and its utter lack of consequences are the only surprise in Steven Tsuchida’s film, a rom-com that so scrupulously fulfills every cliché of the genre, it might as well have been devised by ChatGPT.

Amanda is dispatched to Vietnam to check out a small tour company that Tourista is considering buying to develop its market in the area. The assignment is also a good distraction: She was recently dumped by her dull accountant boyfriend, John (Ben Feldman). Going undercover as a regular tourist, albeit an extremely well-prepared one, she’s immediately drawn to the floppy-haired guide, Sinh (Scott Ly). He is the kind of dreamboat who has both abs and sensitivity, and can show Amanda not just his country’s beauty, but how to enjoy life.

Sinh eventually doffs his shirt at the beach and emerges from the water in resplendent slow motion, because the clichés here are as tightly packed in as tchotchkes in a traveler’s suitcase: Amanda is a perky American Type A; village elders are cute as buttons and wise as Yoda; street food is tantalizing; jaded Westerners rediscover themselves as they ditch their phones and bask in a rural experience made only sweeter by the knowledge that it’s temporary. The soundtrack’s catchy Vietnamese songs provide the only fizz in this otherwise flat concoction.

    "18" : """ “Ghosted,” a frothy spy-thriller rom-com in the tradition of “Romancing the Stone” and “The Jewel of the Nile,” is one of the least convincing movies I have ever seen. I don’t just mean that the dialogue is trite and phony, or that the characters feel inauthentic, or that the action is badly choreographed, or even that the plot is paper-thin and contrived, although all of this is regrettably true.

I mean that “Ghosted” barely seems like a real movie. It has movie stars, in the figures of Ana de Armas and Chris Evans (and, as the villain, Adrien Brody). It has a competent director, Dexter Fletcher, whose hit “Rocketman” wasn’t half-bad.

But this tedious, unfunny, screamingly unoriginal romantic adventure film is so flimsy and so insubstantial that it’s practically vaporous.

Evans, who can be charming, stars as Cole, a clean-cut, down-to-earth farmer who dreams of publishing a book on the history of agriculture. While working at his family market stall one afternoon, he meets Sadie (de Armas), and within minutes the two embark on a high-speed fling. But it turns out that Sadie is a C.I.A. agent, code name the Taxman, and in a gender-reversed “True Lies” situation, Cole is swiftly embroiled in Sadie’s high-stakes world of international espionage, whisked off in escapades across London and far-flung destinations that look like they were filmed on green screens.

Evans and de Armas are likable actors, but any charm they might have mustered for each other is torpedoed by the facile writing, featuring such memorable zingers as “I have dated some crazies in my day, but you are certifiable!”

The spy stuff is also laughable. The movie seems more concerned with shoehorning in transparently fan-baiting cameos (including Sebastian Stan and Ryan Reynolds) than with developing anything remotely like credible stakes, while the action set pieces suffer from unimaginative staging and some of the cheapest-looking visual effects in recent memory.

    "19" : """ Jessica Burstein, a photographer who in extended assignments captured three quintessentially New York institutions — the “Law & Order” television franchise, the new Yankee Stadium as it was being built and the restaurant and celebrity hangout Elaine’s — died on April 11 at her home in Manhattan. She was 76.

The cause was lung cancer, her sister Patricia Burstein said.

In 1992, Ms. Burstein became the official photographer at Elaine’s, the night spot on the Upper East Side of Manhattan where writers, athletes, actors, politicians and filmmakers gathered in a salon overseen by the imperious owner, Elaine Kaufman.

Ms. Burstein came as she pleased, with her only tangible reward the display of her framed pictures on a restaurant wall (Ms. Kaufman did not pay her). Over the next 19 years, until it closed, she photographed scenes from the haunt: Ms. Kaufman counting cash; Joan Rivers resting her head on Ms. Kaufman’s shoulder; a tired-looking Andy Rooney, the CBS commentator, with a drink in hand; a party to celebrate the 100th episode of “Law & Order”; and Christo, the epic-scale fabric artist, in a romantic moment with his wife and collaborator, Jeanne-Claude. She also crafted striking tableside portraits of luminaries like Liza Minnelli and William Styron.

In 2002, Ms. Burstein shot a wild bit of revelry featuring Candace Bushnell, the author of the book “Sex and the City” (1996), which inspired the long-running HBO series of the same title. Ms. Bushnell had her right leg extended and her left leg bent, while one man kissed her ankle and another man held her. In the background, the writer Gay Talese, a longtime Elaine’s patron, was in deep conversation with a woman.

“Candace was a few sheets to the wind,” Ms. Burstein told the journalism blogger Jim Fitzpatrick in 2010. “She would admit that.” Ms. Bushnell had made eye contact with Ms. Burstein, apparently hoping that she would photograph the scene.

In a phone interview, Mr. Talese described the relationship between Ms. Burstein and Ms. Kaufman.

“I think what was significant about Jessica, in addition to her good photography, she was one of the few women that Elaine welcomed and liked,” he said. “She was very engaging, and she wasn’t threatening.”

Ms. Burstein met Dick Wolf, the creator of the “Law & Order” franchise, at Elaine’s in 1993. He soon hired her to photograph the crime scenes that were conceived weekly for the original “Law & Order” series.

She became the show’s photographer in 1994 and stayed until 2010, when it was canceled. (It was revived last year.) She was also the photographer for the spinoffs “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,” until 2007, and “Law & Order: Criminal Intent,” through 2011.

In an email, Mr. Wolf praised Ms. Burstein for “her ability to capture real human emotion in the artificiality of a film set.”

Ms. Burstein and Mr. Wolf collaborated on a 2003 book, “Law & Order: Crime Scenes,” which led to an exhibition of the same name at the George Eastman House in Rochester, N.Y., in 2005.

Jennifer Curtis, who helped design the exhibition, said in a phone interview that Ms. Burstein’s “crime scene photos were similar to Weegee’s,” referring to the celebrated New York City tabloid photographer of the 1930s and ’40s.

Jessica May Burstein was born on April 7, 1947, in Mineola, N.Y., on Long Island, and grew up in nearby Lawrence. Her mother, Beatrice (Sobel) Burstein, was one of the first women to serve as a justice of the New York State Supreme Court. Her father, Herbert, was an international lawyer.

After surgery when she was 8 to correct a condition that caused her right eye to wander, Jessica received a Brownie camera as a therapeutic device. Not long after, she set up a darkroom and began to use a Nikon.

She graduated from New York University with a bachelor’s degree in 1968, then worked for six years as an assistant to the prominent commercial photographer Bert Stern. In 1974, she was hired as a staff photographer at NBC; she is believed to have been the first woman in that job.

“At that time, the reality is, they needed to hire what they considered to be a minority, someone of color or a woman,” she told the newspaper Our Town in 2015.

Ms. Burstein photographed news events and the set of “Saturday Night Live,” and she documented the making of the 1978 mini-series “King,” about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Bud Rukeyser, a former corporate spokesman for NBC, recalled in an email, “She was a star as an NBC photographer and was clearly on her way to a bigger and better career.”

But she told Newsday in 1978 that she had been fired after being pulled off an assignment to photograph Frank Sinatra for a network interview show because Sinatra’s wife didn’t want attractive women near him. Mr. Rukeyser said at the time that she had been laid off with 300 other employees; in his email, he said that he did not recall the Sinatra story.

She freelanced over the years for newspapers like The New York Times and The Washington Post and magazines like TV Guide, Rolling Stone, People, Time and Vanity Fair.

In 2006, she signed on as the exclusive photographer of the construction of the new Yankee Stadium, which would open in April 2009. “There was no competition for the job; we knew Jessie from some work she had already done for us,” Randy Levine, the Yankees’ president, said in a phone interview. “She was a world-class photographer.”

Her photos were used in a commemorative book for holders of Yankee premium season tickets and were exhibited at the stadium.

Ms. Curtis, who continued to work on projects with Ms. Burstein through an exhibition of her photos at the Venice Biennale last year, compared her Yankee Stadium photography to the project Margaret Bourke-White undertook in 1930 to depict the construction of the Chrysler Building.

“Like Bourke-White,” Ms. Curtis said, “Jessica scaled the structure with the support of the men and women who built the stadium to get ‘the shot.’”

Ms. Burstein donated her photo collection to the New-York Historical Society in 2017.

In addition to her sister Patricia, she is survived by another sister, Karen Burstein, a former New York State senator, and two brothers, Judd and John. Jessica and Patricia Burstein worked together on “The Grandmother Book: A Celebration of Family” (2000).

A longtime customer of Elaine’s, Ms. Burstein began her tenure as the restaurant’s photographer when she confided in Ms. Kaufman that her business was slow and that she was thinking of giving it up for law school.

“‘Are you nuts?’ she yelled at me,” Ms. Burstein wrote in an essay in “Elaine’s: The Rise of One of New York’s Most Legendary Restaurants From Those Who Were There” (2015), by Amy Phillips Penn. “‘Quit? Kid, you’re better than Avedon.’”

Ms. Kaufman added, she recalled, “You got no place to shoot, then come here to do it.”

But, Ms. Burstein noted, “Between the cost of film, processing, paper and printing, shooting at Elaine’s was to be the most expensive job I ever had.”

    "20" : """ New Mexico prosecutors are dropping the involuntary manslaughter charges that were filed against Alec Baldwin for the 2021 shooting death of a cinematographer on the set of the film “Rust,” the government’s latest setback as it pursued a high-profile case that has been closely watched by the movie industry and the country.

It was a dramatic reversal in the case against Mr. Baldwin, just months after the prosecutors who originally handled the case had filed charges against him, including one that carried five years in prison. Since then they downgraded that charge, which stemmed from a law that was not in effect at the time of the shooting; the special prosecutor leading the case stepped down after her appointment was challenged on legal grounds; and the district attorney in charge of the case, Mary Carmack-Altwies, stepped back and appointed two new special prosecutors to lead it.

The decision to drop the charges against Mr. Baldwin came after the new prosecutors reviewed new evidence that showed that the gun he was practicing with had been modified before it was delivered to the set, according to an official close to the investigation who was granted anonymity to discuss the case. That undercut the prosecution’s original argument that the gun could not have fired unless Mr. Baldwin had pulled the trigger, the official said.

It is possible that prosecutors could decide to file new charges against Mr. Baldwin.

“New facts were revealed that demand further investigation and forensic analysis in the case against Alec Baldwin,” Kari Morrissey, one of the new special prosecutors, said in a statement. “Therefore, we cannot proceed under the current time constraints and on the facts and evidence turned over by law enforcement in its existing form. This decision does not absolve Mr. Baldwin of criminal culpability and charges may be refiled.”

The shooting occurred on Oct. 21, 2021, when a gun Mr. Baldwin was practicing with on the set of “Rust” went off, killing the film’s cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins, and wounding its director, Joel Souza.

Mr. Baldwin had been told that day that the gun he was practicing with — a replica of a vintage revolver — was “cold,” meaning there was no live ammunition in it. He has maintained from the beginning that he did not pull the trigger before the gun fired, telling investigators that it went off after he had pulled the hammer back and let it go. But the original prosecutors had said that an F.B.I. analysis of the gun showed that he must have pulled the trigger, which contributed to their decision to bring charges.

In a statement, Mr. Baldwin’s lawyers, Luke Nikas and Alex Spiro, said, “We are pleased with the decision to dismiss the case against Alec Baldwin and we encourage a proper investigation into the facts and circumstances of this tragic accident.”

Paperwork officially dismissing those charges is expected to be filed before a status hearing on the case on Friday afternoon.

Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, the film’s armorer, who loaded the gun the day of the shooting and was responsible for weapons on the set of the western, was also charged with involuntary manslaughter in the case. One of her lawyers, Jason Bowles, said that the charges against Ms. Gutierrez-Reed remained.

Filming on the movie is set to resume this week in Montana, where the production has moved from New Mexico. The revived production has Ms. Hutchins’s widower, Matthew Hutchins, as an executive producer.

After the news of the decision on Thursday, Mr. Baldwin posted a photo of himself and his wife on Instagram, writing, “I owe everything I have to this woman.” He added, “(and to you, Luke),” apparently referring to one of his lawyers, Mr. Nikas.

While Mr. Baldwin maintained that he never pulled the trigger, the district attorney, Ms. Carmack-Altwies, a Democrat who was elected in 2020, said when announcing the charges that an F.B.I. analysis of the gun had shown “conclusively” that the trigger had been pulled. But a person with knowledge of the investigation said that Mr. Baldwin’s legal team had recently provided prosecutors with new evidence that the gun had been modified without his knowledge in a way that made it less safe to handle.

The decision to dismiss the charges was the latest in a series of setbacks for the prosecution. After the charges against Mr. Baldwin were downgraded, Andrea Reeb, the special prosecutor originally appointed to handle the case, stepped down after his lawyers argued that her appointment violated a provision in the State Constitution that bars officials from serving in two branches of government, since she is also a state lawmaker.

A judge then ruled that Ms. Carmack-Altwies could not appoint any special prosecutor without recusing herself from the case. So she stepped down from the case last month, appointing Ms. Morrissey and Jason Lewis, New Mexico lawyers, as special prosecutors.

Investigators were not able to determine how live ammunition got onto the “Rust” set. Mr. Baldwin has said that he was following direction as he practiced drawing the gun that day.

“Someone put a live bullet in a gun, a bullet that wasn’t even supposed to be on the property,” Mr. Baldwin said in a television interview on ABC less than two months after the shooting. “Someone is ​responsible for what happened, and I can’t say who that is, but I know it’s not me.”

When her office announced that it was bringing manslaughter charges against Mr. Baldwin in January, Ms. Carmack-Altwies said that he had “an absolute duty to know that what is in the gun that is being placed in his hand is safe” — an assertion that was questioned by some actors, armorers, union leaders and others in the film industry.

SAG-AFTRA, the union representing film, television and radio workers, said in a statement at the time that her “contention that an actor has a duty to ensure the functional and mechanical operation of a firearm on a production set is wrong and uninformed” and added that “an actor’s job is not to be a firearms or weapons expert.”

The movie’s first assistant director, Dave Halls, who had oversight of safety on the “Rust” set, reached a plea deal with Ms. Carmack-Altwies and Ms. Reeb on a charge of negligent use of a deadly weapon. He was sentenced to six months of probation.

A judge in New Mexico will decide next month whether the manslaughter charges against Ms. Gutierrez-Reed should move forward. Her lawyer has said she intends to plead not guilty.

‘Planet Earth III’

When to watch: Saturday at 8 p.m., on BBC America or AMC+.

When “Planet Earth” premiered in the United States in 2007, it was a huge deal — I still remember walking home one night and noticing every TV that glowed through a window seemed to be tuned to the same ocean episode. Since then, sumptuous, epic nature documentaries have proliferated, and televised opportunities to be hypnotized by the majesty of nature abound. Now the third installment is here, as gorgeous and immersive as ever, and reaffirming the franchise’s spot at the top of the genre. Things kick off with “Coasts” — “coasts are on the front line,” David Attenborough says — and segments include seals collectively ganging up on a shark, a turtle resting its head on a rock and drooling in exhaustion and a vulnerable flock of flamingos.

… an hour and I want stand-up.

‘Zainab Johnson: Hijabs Off’

When to watch: Now, on Amazon.

This new stand-up special from the comedian Zainab Johnson covers the difficulties of dating, the role of candy in child abduction, how Harlem has changed and the perils of keeping a journal in a household with 13 children. She has a patient rhythm that belies the tightness of each segment and adds levity to some dark topics. This is also one of the more aesthetically ambitious specials in recent memory; Johnson performs in the round, and the lushness of the visual language creates a sense of a festive grandeur.

William Spetz created and stars in this Swedish dramedy (in Swedish, with subtitles, or dubbed) about Tore, a 27-year-old with a failure to launch, though he says he’s perfectly happy living at home and working at his father’s mortuary. But in the first episode, his beloved father dies, and now he has to launch wether he wants to or not. Tore bounces between wild denial (working extra hard, avoiding caring for his father’s dog) and broad attempts to spread his wings (befriending a drag queen, cultivating a crush on a cute florist). If you like distinctive delayed-coming-of-age stories, watch this.

    "22" : """ “Twilight” adapts a 1958 Friedrich Dürrenmatt detective story. It’s the tale of a retired police chief who returns to his work to find a child murderer. In György Fehér’s adaptation — released internationally in 1990, but now showing in the United States for the first time — the unnamed detective’s investigation begins when a young girl is discovered dead near a statue of an eagle holding a sword. This statue is of a Turul, a long-observed symbol of Hungarian national strength. Much like this arresting image, “Twilight” imposes a uniquely Hungarian perspective on what might have otherwise been simple pulp material.

Fehér’s adaptation sets the story squarely in the Hungarian countryside. It is light on specific details like the year of its events or the names and histories of its principal figures. The emphasis on atmosphere over evidence grants the film a fable-like quality. Even the main suspect is known only to the detective (Péter Haumann) as a giant. Fehér builds up his nightmare using visual techniques that are redolent of his countryman and sometime collaborator, the Hungarian filmmaker Béla Tarr, who is best known for his formally and philosophically challenging epics. (Fehér produced Tarr’s “Sátántangó,” and Tarr is credited as a consultant on this film.)

Tarr’s brutalist influence is visible onscreen, present in the film’s stark black-and-white cinematography, its long takes and Fehér’s elaborate, painterly camera setups. The images create the impression of a bleak landscape, a Hungary where the past, present and future appear drained not only of color, but of hope itself. Fehér’s actors offer muted, naturalistic performances, and Fehér limits the number of camera setups and cuts down on extraneous dialogue. His abundant restrictions make simple elements like cuts to close-ups or the detective plot play as cracking indulgences. It’s a style so minimalist, it approaches maximalism — and this combination of pulp and precision creates an arresting and unique work of film noir.

    "23" : """ In Hollywood these days, radical chic is back in fashion. A number of sexy thrillers that dramatize the history of radical politics or pose provocative hypotheticals about the future of activism have emerged. For my money, none match the incendiary power of “Dry Ground Burning,” a feminist gangster movie from Brazil that spits oil in the face of that country’s political establishment.

Directed by Joana Pimenta and Adirley Queirós, “Dry Ground Burning” is a film about insurrection set in the central Brazilian region of Sol Nascente. Chitara (Joana Darc Furtado) is the leader of an all-female crew that steals oil from underground pipelines, and as the kingpin, she strikes deals with gasoline vendors who sell the product at a discounted price. Chitara’s half sister, Léa (Léa Alves da Silva), an androgynous charmer with a mane of black hair, joins the posse after an eight-year stint in prison, and her arrival inspires several nostalgic conversations that temper the action with hangout-movie vibes. The two siblings nonchalantly discuss their playboy father and Léa’s 12-year-old son, conceived with an ex-con who was murdered.

Meanwhile, their compatriot, Andreia (Andreia Vieira), launches a campaign against the pro-cop candidate running for office. Hers is the Prison People Party, which represents those with criminal records, the working class, and Indigenous and Black people — in other words, those who fared the worst under the policies of Jair Bolsonaro’s far-right government, which was in power when the film was in production.

Because most people aren’t familiar with the films of Pimenta and Queirós, I’m compelled to draw a connection between “Dry Ground Burning” and “Mad Max: Fury Road,” two pyromaniacal dystopian westerns in which lawless women are not only their own saviors but everyone else’s, too.

But if “Fury Road” is a perpetual joyride, “Dry Ground” erupts between smoke breaks, switching between moments of rugged quietude and bracing scenes distinguished by invigorating, industrial sound design and the collective exultation of bodies — like the one with a motorcade carrying the rowdy members of an anarchic political party hollering a profanity-laced campaign jingle. Sodium-lit nightscapes filled with steely, gun-toting dames recall the glossy crime dramas of Michael Mann (“Heat”).

Yet “Dry Ground Burning” isn’t divorced from reality. Though Pimenta and Queirós sprinkle science-fiction touches throughout the film, their approach is steeped in renegade documentary methods and influenced by the contributions of real locals. The cast is composed of nonprofessional actors from the region who play semi-fictionalized versions of themselves — Silva, for instance, joined the production when she was released from prison. In order to clear the streets for the motorcade scene, the People Prison Party was officially registered as a political campaign.

Pimenta and Queirós invent a world in which Brazilian women at the very bottom of the social totem pole take matters into their own hands. They do so without an ounce of fear or self-pity — and in killer style to boot. And it’s not just artist types and famous actors who enact these possibilities, but the very people most empowered by imagining themselves otherwise.

    "24" : """ Loren Cameron was in his early 30s when he went to buy his first suit, walking nervously into unfamiliar territory, a haberdashery for short men. Size was a delicate subject for him. He was 5-foot-3 and wanted so much to be bigger, equating masculinity with heft — which is why he was also a dedicated body builder.

The salesman sized him up “as a regular working-class Joe,” as Mr. Cameron put it, and set out to teach him the rituals of fine dressing. He fitted Mr. Cameron into a double-breasted Italian-made suit, taught him the difference between a half and a full Windsor tie knot, and showed him four variations on folding a pocket square.

He even offered dating advice: Never give a woman a rose on a first date. Offer carnations instead.

Mr. Cameron took a self-portrait in that snappy suit, handsome, bearded and brandishing a bunch of carnations, creating one of many tender and lovely photographs of transgender men like himself that he collected in “Body Alchemy: Transsexual Portraits,” published in 1996.

“I felt at least two inches taller when I walked out of there,” Mr. Cameron wrote of his suit-shopping adventure, “and it wasn’t because of the elevator shoes.”

Mr. Cameron, a photographer and activist whose depictions of transgender people — and documentation of his own experience — inspired a generation, died on Nov. 18 at his home in Berkeley, Calif. He was 63.

The cause was suicide, his sister Susan Tarleton said, adding that he had suffered from congestive heart failure. He had been isolated from friends and family for many years, and his death was not widely reported at the time.

When “Body Alchemy” appeared, it was a revelation. At the time, it was groundbreaking, even radical, to photograph transgender people as regular folk, rather than as exotics or freaks or medical specimens, and rarer still for the lensman to be transgender.

Images of transgender women were more familiar than those of transgender men, and they were often famous figures, like Christine Jorgensen, the American actress whose transition surgery in the 1950s was front-page news, and Jan Morris, the British journalist and travel writer who wrote of her own transition in her 1974 memoir, “Conundrum.”

Over the decades, fine artists like Andy Warhol, Robert Mapplethorpe and Diane Arbus “have all trained their lenses on the transgendered figure,” Kate Bornstein, the gender theorist and author, wrote in The Bay Area Reporter in reviewing “Body Alchemy” upon its release. “Never have the transgendered seriously photographed their own. Not until Loren Cameron, that is.”

In “Body Alchemy,” for perhaps the first time, transgender men could see representations of themselves outside of the pages of medical texts.

There was Jeffrey, a Jewish man who had yearned to be a bar mitzvah, affirming his heritage, and was able to do so. Mr. Cameron photographed him in a prayer shawl and yarmulke.

Brynn, a rangy surfer, was shown in the back of his van pulling on his wet suit, short board at the ready. Stephan, a police sergeant who was honored for his valor and who transitioned while on the job, was framed against his squad car.

There were nudes, too, the most potent of which was a photo of Mr. Cameron in a classic bodybuilder pose, back arched, muscles rippling, his body emblazoned with flame-shaped tattoos, injecting his buttock with a syringe of testosterone.

Mr. Cameron wrote eloquently and honestly of the challenges of therapies, like his biweekly testosterone shot, which played havoc with his mood, escalating his temper and often making him emotionally distant from his partner, Kayt, a lesbian.

He framed a pair of portraits of himself with the typical responses his body often provoked, rendered in a bold typeface: “You’re so exotic! May I take your photograph?” “You must be some kind of freak.” “You don’t belong here.”

Despite such bigotry and stigma, Mr. Cameron’s observations reflected “a kind of innocence and awe of the body,” Patricia Holt wrote in her review for The San Francisco Examiner in 1997. She called the book a “poignant yet matter-of-fact study” of transgender people that was both “sensitive and insightful.”

Susan Stryker, the transgender historian, connected Mr. Cameron’s “breakthrough,” as she put it in a phone interview, to the AIDS crisis, when shifting notions of queer identity and community “allowed trans people previously marginalized within feminist and gay activism” to find greater visibility. “Loren was on the ground as that change was happening, and he documented it from the inside,” she said.

Mr. Cameron’s work was exhibited all over the country, in galleries and universities like Cornell, to which he donated his papers in the early 2000s, when he was in his early 40s. Among his papers is his high school yearbook showing a young woman as class president. “I was cute, huh?” Mr. Cameron wrote in the margin before he sent it to Cornell.

“He wasn’t invested in hiding that he had been a woman,” said Brenda Marston, curator of Cornell’s Human Sexuality Collection. “He put his whole body and soul out there.”

Loren Rex Cameron was born on March 13, 1959, in Pasadena, Calif. His mother, Barbara (Chambers) Cameron, was an office manager at Sears. After her death in 1968, he moved to Dover, Ark., to live with his father, Robert, a nuclear engineer and nuclear plant manager.

Robert Cameron had a farm and raised horses, and Loren worked alongside him, building fences and taking care of the horses. He was daring and adventurous as a teenager, as he wrote in “Body Alchemy,” drag racing and rafting swollen rivers. He dressed in overalls and work boots and learned to swear like a trucker.

He was deeply uncomfortable in his female body, and at age 12 he wrote away for information on sex changes. When a friend suggested that he might be a lesbian, he thought, “Why not?” But classmates began to treat him as an outcast, and he quit school and ran away from home, traveling the country by bus. He found work picking fruit and cleaning construction sites.

He ran a truck-stop fuel station and joined a youth conservation-corps crew, where he met a group of lesbians, who told him that he might find a like-minded community in San Francisco.

He lived as a lesbian for nine years before addressing his discomfort with his gender. He was 26 and had recently quit smoking pot and cigarettes. “For the first time in my life, I wasn’t numb,” he wrote.

As he began to transition, he took snapshots of the process, sending them to family and friends so they could get used to his new body and also see how happy he was. “What was initially a crude documentation of my personal journey became an impassioned mission,” he wrote. He took a basic photography class, bought a simple Pentax K1000 and began photographing other transgender people and learning their stories.

“I wanted the world to see us,” he wrote, “I mean, really see us.”

In addition to his sister Ms. Tarleton, Mr. Cameron is survived by two other sisters, Catanya Saltzman and Cameron Oppenheim, and a stepsister, Lynne Kelly.

Mr. Cameron often said his aesthetic was influenced by the photography books his parents had at home, work by Walker Evans and Dorothea Lange that made vivid the stories his father had told of growing up poor during the Depression. His work ethic was inspired by his father, who taught him to mend fences and bale hay — to honor manual labor.

“The last time I saw him, he told me that I had a lot of guts to move to California with only a duffel bag and a hundred bucks in my pocket,” Mr. Cameron wrote. “I think if he could see me now, he would be proud to call me his son.”

    "25" : """ Ten years ago, Dance Theater of Harlem was reborn. Founded in 1969, the company had gone into hiatus in 2004, saddled with debt; in 2013, it returned to the stage — full of hope and promise but shaky. Its first New York program opened with “Agon,” a difficult and exposing ballet by George Balanchine, the company’s artistic godfather, and what the performance exposed was that there was a lot of work to do.

What a difference on Wednesday, when the troupe opened its program at New York City Center with another challenging piece by Balanchine, “Allegro Brillante.” All was radiance, sparkle and joy flowing from sure technique. And all this was a testament to how well Virginia Johnson, the former company star who returned as artistic director, has led the troupe back to health. She’s now stepping down, and she can be assured she has done her job.

The lead dancers in “Allegro Brillante,” Amanda Smith and Kouadio Davis, were wonderful. Davis is solid, dependable. Smith is luxuriant. She basks in the music, milks the steps, and if she struggles a little in the middle of a quick sequence, she knows how to sell the capping pose. But the revived company has long featured a few standouts. More significant was the strength and spirit of the four backing couples: no weak links.

That’s a happy sight, a triumphant achievement, even though another erratic aspect of Johnson’s tenure — the quality of commissioned works — stayed erratic in the program’s two New York premieres.

“Sounds of Hazel” is a worthy and well-meaning project. It is a tribute to Hazel Scott, a virtuosic pianist from Harlem who was a glamorous star (appearing in movies as herself, starring in her own TV show) and also a civil rights role model (both on her own and as the wife of the congressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr.) before her career was destroyed in the Red Scare of the 1950s. We learn about her remarkable, underappreciated life in an effective introductory video and program essay. But the ballet itself is a disappointment.

Oddly, it doesn’t feature much music by Scott. We hear her version of Chopin’s “Minute Waltz,” giving us a taste of the swinging-the-classics style for which she was known, and a later track of straight-ahead Ellingtonian jazz. But mostly we hear an original score by the D.J. and composer Erica Blunt that largely sounds like hotel lounge music from the early 2000s — samples of muted trumpet with beats.

Worse, the choreography, by Tiffany Rea-Fisher, doesn’t illuminate its biographical subject. In the introductory video, Rea-Fisher tells us that the polyrhythms of Trinidad, Scott’s birthplace, allowed her to swing the classics so well, yet the dance fails to bring that idea to life. Paris, where she later lived in exile, is bizarrely represented by a kind of mannequin dance set to a music-box version of “La Vie en Rose.”

We do hear Scott’s voice, giving an amazingly calibrated, Obama-like radio speech about her love of America, despite its flaws. But what’s missing most of all is an equivalent for Scott’s virtuosity. Daphne Lee, as a Scott figure in a sparkly gown, captures her panache from the waist up, winking and miming piano playing, a bit absurdly. But Rea-Fisher doesn’t give Lee any steps that rival Scott’s thrilling runs, lighting left-hand patterns or cross-hand tricks. The showy articulateness of ballet would seem to be the perfect embodiment of Scott’s style, but here it is merely gestured at. The essential flaw of the work is too much telling, not enough showing.

It’s not as though the company’s dancers lack the technique to do Scott justice. They demonstrate it in delicious abundance in the other premiere, William Forsythe’s “Blake Works IV.” As the title indicates, this is part of a series, made for other dancers and companies, set to the moody, electronic soul music of James Blake. For a digital version created at the height of the coronavirus pandemic, it acquired a focus on the ballet barre, playfully exaggerating the side-to-side logic of barre exercises.

This iteration closely resembles previous ones, but it is this company’s first work by Forsythe, and its sexiness suits them. The solo-after-solo structure is here strung out to include 15 dancers, but that formal sameness is forgivable as, one after another, they spin and shine in individualized ways.

These dancers can do Forsythe, and they can do Balanchine. They don’t have to tell you that Dance Theater of Harlem is once again a great ballet company. They show it.

    "26" : """ He turned Will Smith into a cerulean genie for the 2019 live-action “Aladdin” and twice reimagined Sherlock Holmes as a swashbuckling rogue, to hefty box-office returns. As a filmmaker, though, Guy Ritchie has long been synonymous with sprawling ensemble pictures like “Snatch,” “The Gentlemen” and “Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels”: laddish, kinetic crime capers larded with movie stars, bloodied knuckles and inscrutable Cockney accents. (The latest of such outings, an antic international spy lark called “Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre” featuring Jason Statham, Hugh Grant and Aubrey Plaza, arrived to middling fanfare this past March.)

So why is “Guy Ritchie’s The Covenant,” a somber-looking Afghanistan war drama about an American sergeant (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his Afghan interpreter (Dar Salim), the first of the director’s 15 features to formally bear his name? The answer, according to its U.S. distributor, MGM, turns out to be fairly prosaic: Another company had already asserted rights to the title. (“Lee Daniels’ The Butler,” produced by the Weinstein Company, faced a similar challenge in court from Warner Brothers in 2013 and lost, precipitating a hasty last-minute change.)

But this kind of déjà vu is hardly new: Broad-strokes monikers like “Crash,” “Heat" and “Rush” have all done double duty over the last few decades; “Twilight” is the name of both a poorly received 1998 neo-noir starring Paul Newman and Susan Sarandon and the 2008 teen-vampire juggernaut that launched four fanged, lugubrious sequels, as well as a cult 1990 mystery by the Hungarian filmmaker György Fehér. (Ritchie might have called his latest‌ ‌ “The Interpreter” instead, had that appellation not already been claimed by a 2005 Sydney Pollack political thriller starring Nicole Kidman; so back, alas, to the drawing board.)

If the back story of “The Covenant” wanders into the weeds of copyright law, “Guillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio,” which won the Academy Award for best animated feature last month, makes an easier case for its qualifier: Without it, the movie could hardly be set apart from both the 1940 Disney classic still widely seen as definitive and an uncanny remake led by Tom Hanks — it currently sits at a grim 29 percent approval rating on the critical-aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes — released less than two months before.

In a larger sense, though, the inclusion of del Toro’s name also serves as shorthand and a promise, portending not only the age-old tale of a wooden boy made real but the particular vision of its maker — a lush, prolific fantasist famed for the distinctive visual style and dazzling gothic grotesqueries of films like “Pan’s Labyrinth” (2006) and the best picture-winning “The Shape of Water” (2017). That del Toro actually split directing duties for “his” “Pinocchio” with Mark Gustafson seems almost a footnote. Though Gustafson, an industry journeyman with a wide range of writing and animation credits (“Fantastic Mr. Fox," the original California Raisins), shared both the stage and the statuette with del Toro at this year’s Oscars ceremony, it’s the latter’s renown, by most Hollywood metrics, that matters.

With “Pinocchio” and the 2022 Netflix horror-anthology series “Guillermo del Toro’s Cabinet of Curiosities,” the director joins a long line of auteurs, from Alfred Hitchcock to Tim Burton, whose presence not merely above the title but in it serves as a stylistic marker, even when it’s not strictly their hand guiding the material. (The horror godhead Wes Craven habitually did the same; see “Wes Craven’s New Nightmare.”) Few, though, can claim to be the one-man industry that is Tyler Perry, who retains full ownership of the projects produced under his personal shingle at his stand-alone studio in Atlanta. The multihyphenate creator has famously put‌‌ his signature on several movie and television titles released under its umbrella — including “Tyler Perry’s A Madea Homecoming,” the most recent iteration of the reliably raucous comedies that he also writes and stars in as a salty, well-cushioned matriarch of a certain age.

While Madea is Perry’s wholesale creation, indubitably linked to the man who wears her wig onscreen, certain intellectual properties with roots that reach back centuries have tilted their brims instead toward a more literal (and literary) acknowledgment of the source. Think of the high-gloss 1990s productions “Bram Stoker’s Dracula” (directed by Francis Ford Coppola) and “Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein” (directed by Kenneth Branagh): It takes both the budget and the personal leverage of a prestige director, one presumes, to lay claim to the definitive versions of characters who have long been turned over to the public domain. Neither movie did much service to these iconic novels, but show business, as always, carries on: Coppola’s four-decades-in-the-making passion project “Megalopolis,” which wrapped shooting several weeks ago, was funded in part, he has publicly said, by his long-ago work on “Bram Stoker’s Dracula.” And Branagh, having recently mined his own Irish childhood for the dewy black-and-white drama “Belfast” (which won him an Oscar for original screenplay), will next direct and star as Hercule Poirot in his third Agatha Christie adaptation in six years, “A Haunting in Venice,” due this September. Neither he nor Christie is officially billed in the title.

    "27" : """ The New York Philharmonic, saying it hoped to use culture to help ease political tensions, announced plans on Thursday for a summer tour in Asia, including stops in Hong Kong and Taiwan and a visit to mainland China by a small group of musicians.

The tour will be the Philharmonic’s first visit to Asia since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, when many countries in the region shut their borders. It comes amid rising tensions between the United States and China and concerns about the possibility of a crisis over Taiwan.

Gary Ginstling, the Philharmonic’s incoming president and chief executive, said the orchestra hoped to show that music could help strengthen ties between the United States and Asian countries.

“At a time when communication and trust are on the decline, our firm belief is that cultural diplomacy is more important than ever,” he said. “Showing that we can span borders and bring people closer through music is at the heart of our mission.”

After a hiatus during the pandemic, American and European ensembles have in recent months explored returning to Asia, a booming market for classical music before the pandemic.

The Philadelphia Orchestra, the first American ensemble to perform in Communist-led China, is planning to send a delegation of 12 musicians to Beijing and Shanghai this fall. (Last year, the orchestra canceled a tour to celebrate the 50th anniversary of its visit to the country in 1973, worried that China’s then-strict coronavirus protocols would create logistical challenges.)

The Cleveland Orchestra is planning an Asia tour in 2025 that could include a visit to China, as well as Japan and South Korea. The Boston Symphony Orchestra visited Japan last year, the ensemble’s first overseas tour in four years.

The New York Philharmonic’s Asia tour will include performances in late June and early July at the Hong Kong Cultural Center as well as performing arts centers in Taipei and Kaohsiung, a city in southern Taiwan. The orchestra will perform Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony, Dvorak’s Ninth Symphony, Tchaikovsky’s Sixth Symphony and Brahms’s Violin Concerto, featuring the violinist Hilary Hahn.

Hong Kong is familiar terrain for the Philharmonic’s music director, Jaap van Zweden, who also leads the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra.

“I look forward to sharing the work of my New York musical family with audiences in both Taiwan and Hong Kong,” van Zweden said in a statement.

The pandemic forced the Philharmonic to cancel three previously scheduled trips to China, where it has had a partnership with the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra since 2014. Following the visit to Hong Kong in July, a delegation of nine Philharmonic players will go to Shanghai for six days, where they will lead chamber music concerts and teach classes.

The Philharmonic is also working to strengthen ties with Taiwanese cultural groups; on Friday, it will present a concert at David Geffen Hall by the Taiwan Philharmonic.

Ginstling said the orchestra was considering a full tour in mainland China in the summer of 2024.

“It’s too early to commit to that,” he said. “But we’ve certainly made it clear to our friends in Shanghai that when the circumstances warrant and enable it, we will resume our visits with the full orchestra.”

    "28" : """ Helen Barolini, a novelist, essayist and poet who explored the challenges of assimilation, as well as the hard-won victories of feminist emancipation experienced by Italian American women, died on March 29 at her home in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. She was 97.

Her death was confirmed by her daughter Teodolinda Barolini.

A native of Syracuse, N.Y., whose grandparents immigrated from southern Italy in the late 19th century, Ms. Barolini brought their journey, and those of many others, to life in “Umbertina,” her celebrated 1979 historical novel tracing four generations of women in a single Italian American family as they come to terms with their origins and identity in a new land, and with an ever-changing social landscape.

“It is the Madonna of Italian American literature in that it shows the transition from the Italian immigrant to American citizen like no other book of its genre,” Fred Gardaphé, then the director of Italian American studies at SUNY Stony Brook on Long Island and now a professor at the City University of New York, was quoted as saying in an article in The New York Times in 1999, when the book was reissued.

Throughout Ms. Barolini’s career, her work was animated by the belief that Italian American women were underrepresented, not only as subjects in American literature but also as authors, and that as a group they faced what she called a “double erasure, both as Italians and as women,” Teodolinda Barolini said in a phone interview.

Committed throughout her life to promoting Italian poetry and literature, she always sought to broaden the depictions of her people in popular culture beyond “Sopranos”-style stereotypes, while giving voice to those previously unheard.

Such beliefs inspired her influential 1985 compilation of short fiction, memoirs and poems, “The Dream Book: An Anthology of Writings by Italian American Women.”

“I think Italian American literature belongs, interestingly enough, not so much in immigrant literature but in the kind of literature that deals with the outsider,” she said in a 1993 interview published in Melus, a journal devoted to multiethnic literature. “Jews have done this, and Blacks have done this; and they have very pronounced figures — very interesting figures that they have created of the isolated person in an alien society.”

“The Blacks, the Jews, the Irish all have their spokesmen,” she added. “Why not the Italians?”

Helen Frances Mollica was born on Nov. 18, 1925, the eldest of three children of Anthony Mollica, the son of Sicilian immigrants and a self-made man who built a thriving fruit importation and distribution business, and Angela (Cardamone) Mollica, the daughter of immigrants from Calabria.

A gifted student throughout her youth, Ms. Barolini graduated with honors from Syracuse University in 1947, and afterward traveled to Italy to study its culture, history and literature. The next year, she met her future husband, the esteemed Italian novelist and poet Antonio Barolini, in Florence.

The couple married in 1950, had three daughters, and spent a decade bouncing between Italy and the United States, where Ms. Barolini earned a master’s degree in library science from Columbia University. She also worked as a translator of Italian literature, including her husband’s short stories, which were published in English in The New Yorker.

In those early years, “I saw my husband as the more important writer,” she told Melus. “It was after I began to get more in touch with myself that I said, ‘Wait a minute, I want to write. I don’t want to just be the carrier of someone else’s voice.’”

With a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, Ms. Barolini began work on “Umbertina.” The seed of the idea came on a 1965 trip to Calabria, where she discovered a heart-shaped tin sewing kit like those used by rural Italian women in her grandmother’s day.

Taking the time and setting as a starting point, she meticulously researched the historical conditions of each era portrayed in the book, and infused the narrative with a feminist sensibility owing to Betty Friedan, the author of the landmark 1963 book “The Feminine Mystique,” and others. While outwardly a tale of diaspora, “I still think that ‘Umbertina’ is more a feminist statement,” Ms. Barolini later said.

In addition to her daughter Teodolinda, Ms. Barolini is survived by two other daughters, Nicoletta and Susanna Barolini; a brother, Anthony Mollica Jr.; and five grandchildren.

In later books like “Chiaroscuro: Essays on Identity” and “Their Other Side: Six American Women and the Lure of Italy,” Ms. Barolini returned to the subjects and themes that propelled “Umbertina.”

“Theirs was an epic in American life, and it should be written,” she said in the Melus interview, referring to immigrant women like her forebears, “for they who lived it kept no diaries. But we descendants can write and tell, and it’s time now before the last of them die out.”

    "29" : """ There is a feeling of total bodily stimulation in Times Square — the visual excess of signage and language that ‌threatens to overwhelm you, the buzzing artificial light that can shake you upright. For Chryssa, the mononymous, ‌Athens-born artist, th‌at experience, on her first night in New York City in 1955, when she was 21 and still focused on painting, was catalytic. In its pulsating lights and screaming advertisements she saw profound poetry; as she put it to a reporter a decade later: “Times Square I knew had this great wisdom — it was Homeric.”

Those few square blocks propelled her own series of experiments with electric light, neon and industrial materials into dizzyingly beautiful wall reliefs of commercial sign fragments, interrogating consumerist ideology with easily-had materials, ideas that the Pop artists and Minimalists would take another few years to get to, and that put her at the fore of the period’s avant-garde. ‌

By 1961 Chryssa was exhibiting at the Betty Parsons Gallery and had a solo show at the Guggenheim. Two years later, she was part of “Americans 1963” at the Museum of Modern Art alongside Robert Indiana, Claes Oldenburg and Ad Reinhardt. But time has been unkind to her legacy. Like Agnes Martin, with whom Chryssa shared an intimate friendship and whose work too has only recently been reappraised, she slipped from the art world’s consciousness. (It didn’t help that the complexity of conserving 50-year-old wiring makes for a tougher sell than a tidy painting.) There hasn’t been a major Chryssa exhibition ‌in this country since 1982, a breach happily cured by “Chryssa & New York,” a survey organized by the Dia Art Foundation and the Menil Collection‌ that has opened at Dia’s Chelsea gallery.

With 62 works, the show, curated by Megan Holly Witko of Dia and Michelle White from the Menil, does not mean to be exhaustive‌; ‌it nimbly survey‌s Chryssa’s fluidity (in addition to her human-scale, electrified sculptures, there are examples in plaster, bronze, marble and terra-cotta) and argu‌es successfully for her place in art’s firmament.

Chryssa Vardea-Mavromichali was born in Athens in 1933 and grew up amid the Nazi occupation of Greece, where she recalled seeing the cryptic messages scrawled on walls by Greece’s underground resistance, an introduction to the elastic potential of language that colored her work. Her wartime experience led her to become a social worker in the early 1950s, but she soon tired of government obstinacy.

She traveled to Paris, taking art classes at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière and stalking museums, where she first encountered American art, attracted to what she viewed as its lack of history. America was, “I thought at the time, a country of barbarians,” she said in a 1967 interview. “Self-expression was more possible.” Chryssa’s enchantment with the grime of Times Square was somewhat left-handed this way, alive to its beauty but not entirely romantic. She recognized in it the vulgarity of America, and took that as a kind of freedom — “How can you work next to the Parthenon?” she posed to a reporter in 1962.

Chryssa’s practice connect‌ed with Minimalism’s strategies of removing the artist’s hand and using non-art materials. She often worked with glassblowers and welders, scavenging her materials from scrap yards and haunting the plumbing suppliers along Canal Street. But where her peers could be petulant (Dan Flavin despised being called a light artist, demeaning it as technofetishism) or myopic in rejecting the past, Chryssa approached the newness of her art with an openness that made room for classicism.

Chryssa’s first blush with Times Square ignited an abiding fascination with the way language’s delivery can be augmented, and her earliest work with light seeks to exploit its complicity in that process. ‌At Dia, her “Projections,” sculptural arrangements of raised spikes that sprout from their cast aluminum surfaces, as if by photosynthesis, create ‌the suggestion of arrows, letters or the patterns of birds in flight. They riff on the ancient Greek advancements of the sundial, making natural light part of their deal, allowing ‌their surfaces to shift and dance as a viewer moves around them. Chryssa was after something similar with the‌ “Cycladic Books,” serene white-plaster bas-reliefs, cast from the bottoms of cardboard boxes, that flatten the ancient Greek figures to which their title refers into literal tabulae rasae — books whose contents are smoothed into indecipherability.

Both series prod at the limits of language (the “Cycladic Books” are, hauntingly, mute), a concern that finds fuller expression in her series of newspaper prints, canvases densely stamped, often with old printing blocks Chryssa rescued from The New York Times, with the graphic information of a newspaper’s columns, reproduced into ecstatic illegibility. (These were especially pacemaking; Andy Warhol debuted his silk-screens of repeating dollar bills in 1962, the year after Chryssa’s Guggenheim show). The newspaper prints accumulate text to the point of collapse, an acknowledgment of language’s paradox, its capacity to at once reveal and conceal. As she told a reporter in 1966, “I have always felt that when things are spelled out they mean less, and when fragmented they mean more.”

That effect is wittily illustrated in “Times Square Sky” (1962), a writhing wall relief of clamoring aluminum letterforms suffocating one another. Floating at the top, inset in icy electric blue, is the word “air,” as in the argon gas passing through the tube — a canny bit of self-reflexive wordplay that allows the piece to describe itself — and the familiar relief of pushing your way on 42nd Street into an inch of personal space.

lso here is “The Gates to Times Square” (1964-66), the artist’s masterwork, a hulking paean to the city’s street-level energy and the complete expression of her original encounter, which took ‌a decade to metabolize. “The Gates” condenses that thrum into a 10-by-10-foot exploded cube of stainless steel, plexiglass and neon tubing. It absorbs the very stuff of the city‌ — its slick modernist skyscrapers and tangles of scaffolding, the orderliness of its grid system‌ — but also its psychic effects: its vertiginous density, jumble of languages, and the cascading come-ons and entreaties of storefront signage. Newly restored, the sculpture buzzes in a far corner like an altar to some neon god, at once ominous and magnetic.

“The Gates” calls back to its heraldic forebears — the Lion Gate in Mycenae, Greece; Hadrian’s Arch; the Brandenburg Gate; Shinto temple torii — as though you could access another realm by passing through its portal. (‌You could actually do this at its debut at Pace, in 1966, where the spacing of its four bisected monoliths was a bit more generous.) But like the newspaper prints, the torqued signage and neon lettering of “The Gates” is abstracted into uselessness, suggesting an articulation of the limitless possibilities of interpretation, maybe, or how infrequently we succeed in understanding one another.

At Dia, “The Gates” is attended to by smaller neon works that Chryssa considered studies‌ — coils of tubing set inside plexiglass boxes tinted the color of smoke, meant to recreate the particular behavior of Times Square light at night, the way its polluted haze remains suspended in air. One of the best of these, “Study for the Gates #2,” exploits neon’s seductive ‌power and inverts it, courtesy of a timer, cycling for what feels like an eternity (27 seconds) and blinking for a two-second gasp before throwing the whole thing back into darkness. What is revealed is hardly as important as being made to wait for it‌: a pile of wires and rheostats transformed into a sculpture that breathes in an endless night.

Neon is an effective metaphor for America: a shorthand for its technological advancement and its failure to produce progress, forfeited to market consumer products, an idea visualized by Times Square with disorientating efficiency. But while Chryssa was suspicious of mass communication, ‌she wasn’t resigned to its inevitability. By dismantling language, she identified its obscuring methods and offered an alternative, surpassing its chaos with her own, freer grammar. “The Gates” can be viewed as a homage to Times Square but also an exit from it, an understanding that the only way out is to elbow your way through.

    "30" : """ The British writer and actress Daisy May Cooper spent a lot of time on the internet forum Mumsnet when her marriage was breaking down. The site is “like Reddit, but for mothers,” Cooper said in a recent interview at a London cafe while taking a puff from a small blue vape.

She was especially drawn, she said, to one of the site’s most popular threads, “Am I Being Unreasonable?,” a supportive community for women second-guessing themselves in relationships. It became the inspiration — and title — for Cooper’s latest television show, which she created with Selin Hizli. The show, which both star in, is available in the United States on Hulu.

Cooper, 36, rose to fame in Britain in 2017 after creating and starring in the BAFTA-winning BBC mockumentary series “This Country” with her brother, Charlie. She is a regular fixture on British comedy panel shows, known for her candor and colorful language.

But in November 2020, two months after the birth of her second child, she separated from her husband, moved out and began searching for solace online. She recalled feeling frightened and unsure of what her next project might be. “‘My career defined me, and now I don’t know who I am, or what I want, and these two human beings are dependent on me,’” she remembered thinking.

Hizli, a friend of Cooper’s from drama school, was also in the process of splitting up with a long-term partner. The two reconnected during this period and started writing the show that became “Am I Being Unreasonable.” A wild and twisty comedy-thriller, it stars Cooper as Nic, a bored housewife who strikes up an intense friendship with a fellow mother, Jen (Hizli).

“We thought, wouldn’t it be great to write something about a female friend being the partner you always needed, especially when your life’s falling apart?” Cooper said over a cup of tea, a wall behind her adorned with hearts.

In a phone interview, Hizli, 34, said she wanted to see mothers of her age and working-class background represented onscreen. “I had forgotten how important friendship was,” she said, “and how much I needed friends in my life.” In the show, Nic and Jen bond over shots of sambuca and dancing to the Spice Girls.

But Cooper and Hizli wanted to portray the darker side of female friendship, too. Cooper described past intense friendships “that felt like toxic relationships I’d had with boyfriends,” including a best friend who Cooper said was secretly sleeping with her boyfriend at the time. When she found out, it was like “a Keyser Söze mug drop moment,” Cooper said, likening the shocking discovery to the ending of the film “The Usual Suspects.”

“I can only write about what I’m going through, or at least base a character around my own experiences,” she said. Cooper described Kerry Mucklowe, the character she plays in “This Country,” as someone who knows exactly who she is. “Kerry was more of me before fame, and then Nic was more of me after,” she added. Reaching for her vape, Cooper seemed more muted than either of those characters, and described herself as an anxious person these days.

Cooper explored the humor and the hardship of growing up in public housing on the outskirts of a picturesque English village in “This Country” and in her 2021 memoir, “Don’t Laugh, It’ll Only Encourage Her.” In the latter, she described playing board games by candlelight because there was not enough money to switch the electricity on.

She had always acknowledged her faults to make other people laugh, Cooper said, and growing up she aspired to be like TV comedians who gave her parents “moments of complete escapism” from their financial struggles. She then channeled those tendencies into writing and acting.

On their first day as students at London’s prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, or RADA, in 2007, Hizli remembered a teacher telling them “they were going to dismember us and put us back together.” Cooper, Hizli said, would never have allowed herself to be remade: “She was always unapologetically herself, and never felt the need to conform to the expectations of this quite stuffy drama school.”

Miranda Harcourt, Cooper’s acting coach, praised Cooper’s unusual faculty for what she described as both light and dark fire. “There are some brilliant British performers who have got the capacity for lightness and comedy, but don’t show you their tragic side,” Harcourt said in a recent video interview from her home in Wellington, New Zealand.

After the success of “This Country,” Cooper and her brother finally had some of the financial stability they had been chasing. Their lives changed overnight, Cooper said. “Nobody tells you how to deal with it,” she said. “I think he’s as overwhelmed by it as me,” she said of Charlie, becoming tearful. “When we were poor, we were so much closer,” she said. “I think money and schedules and work have ruined that a bit,” she added.

Her collaboration with Hizli was the result of a similarly intimate bond. On both shows, Cooper said the writing was effortless. “They are the ones on the computer typing, and I’m just stomping around vaping,” she said, laughing.

Since RADA, Cooper had dreamed of acting in a film and attending a premiere, and so when the writer and director Armando Iannucci asked her to play Peggotty in his “The Personal History of David Copperfield,” she said she felt she had done what she set out to do. In a phone interview, Iannucci, who also cast her in the HBO comedy series “Avenue 5,” said that Cooper defies convention with everything she does.

“I think I could only do the acting thing for another few years,” Cooper said, adding that she preferred writing and being behind the scenes. Though several British newspapers recently reported rumors that she has been tapped to play M in the next James Bond film, she said that “no talks have happened whatsoever.” Cooper said she would have to make the character funny, though she was not sure if that ‌would work. “I’ve never actually seen a Bond film, so I wouldn’t know,” she said with a filthy cackle.

These days, Cooper is back living in her hometown, Cirencester, a historic town in southwestern England she said few people leave.

There, “people know me for eating crayons in Year 6 as opposed to being on television,” she said, adding that there was nowhere else she would rather be in the entire world.

    "31" : """ Jaune Quick-to-See Smith was sitting on the shore of a lake in Montana when she had an epiphany. An artist and curator, Smith was visiting the Flathead Reservation — the home of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, of which she is a citizen. She’d been born on the reservation in 1940 and later moved to Albuquerque. On this trip, in 1991, as she looked out at the landscape that had helped shape her, she realized that she needed to do a better job of communicating. “I’m making paintings and I know what they’re about but the viewer doesn’t,” she recalled in a recent interview.

Then came the light-bulb moment: Her works were about contemporary Native life, but they were more abstract, less direct in approach. “What if I cut articles out of the newspaper, glue them in, and paint on them, like Rauschenberg did?” she thought.

Smith liked Robert Rauschenberg’s process of incorporating cutouts into his works, building his famous collage aesthetic that placed a medley of objects and images on equal footing. “But if I do it,” Smith told herself, “I can make it so that it really says something.”

She started placing newspaper clippings on her canvases and painting around and over them. As the idea took hold, she made the layouts more purposeful: juxtaposing excerpts from The New York Times and the Flathead Reservation’s Char-Koosta News, as well as other printed snippets, that, when read together, became suggestive and rhythmic, creating what Smith calls her “rap.” She added found images, bits of fabric, and more expressive passages of paint, all of it simmering behind large, simply rendered icons, like a canoe. In 1992, she hung above one such canvas a series of objects featuring racist Native stereotypes, including a baseball cap from the Cleveland Indians. With a twist of dry humor, she titled her piece, which stretched 14 feet long, “Trade (Gifts for Trading Land With White People).”

That monumental, still stunning artwork sits at the heart of “Jaune Quick-to-See Smith: Memory Map,” opening this week at the Whitney Museum of American Art. The exhibition includes some 130 pieces from over five decades, making it the artist’s largest survey. Smith’s is the first retrospective of a Native artist that the New York institution has itself organized, a fact that’s less surprising than it is vexing.

“It forces the question of, why not before? Why not more attention to contemporary Indigenous art?” said Laura Phipps, the Whitney’s assistant curator who organized the exhibition with Caitlin Chaisson, a curatorial project assistant. “We’re constantly questioning what ‘American’ means, but in a lot of those conversations, the idea of Native America has not been a part of that.”

Smith’s retrospective arrives as the map of the art world seems to be shifting: Contemporary Native artists have been more visible and sought after than ever before, in museum commissions and collections and in galleries. Smith, 83, also has a commission in Counterpublic, a new triennial in St. Louis, and is curating an exhibition featuring some 50 Native artists at the National Gallery of Art. The show, which will open in September, represents more overdue firsts: the first time an artist has ever curated an exhibition there and the first show of Native art at the NGA in 30 years.

But if the current wave of attention has opened up new possibilities for Indigenous artists, particularly younger ones, credit is due less to the institutions than to Smith and others of her generation for the tireless work they did to “break the buckskin ceiling,” in her words. The Whitney retrospective makes that clear. Although Smith’s curating and activism are represented only minimally, her paintings, prints and sculptures demonstrate how she took various modern and postmodern artistic languages, including collage, appropriation and Pop Art, and made them her own — or, as she would say, made them Native.

Take, for example, “Trade (Gifts for Trading Land With White People),” which, according to the Choctaw-Cherokee artist Jeffrey Gibson, “offers so much allowance and freedom for Native artists.” Gibson spoke of the challenges he has felt in trying to be a Native artist, activist, educator and parent simultaneously. “You need a unified model of how someone can be the same person in all those spaces,” he said. “Jaune has provided that for me.”

Smith has always occupied multiple roles. She and her sister were raised by their father, Arthur, after their mother, who gave birth to Smith as a teenager, left. Arthur was a horse trader, and while attending school, Smith worked with him — and in canneries and on farms — throughout her childhood. One of her favorite escapes was to hide in a tree and read books.

Smith didn’t get an advanced art degree until she was 40. In high school, a white adviser told her, “Indians don’t go to college,” so she did college prep. When an art teacher told her she drew better than the men, but that “women cannot be artists,” she got an art education degree. Along the way, she met her partner, Andy Ambrose, had children, and worked a variety of jobs to help support them. (Her son Neal Ambrose-Smith is also an artist; two of their collaborations are on view at the Whitney.)

In 1976, Smith moved to Albuquerque and started auditing art classes at the University of New Mexico, — it took three applications until the school admitted her. There, she and the Indigenous artists Larry Emerson, Conrad House, Felice Lucero, Emmi Whitehorse and Paul Willeto formed a collective called Grey Canyon. “She’s like a mother hen,” said Whitehorse, who is Navajo and was then an undergraduate at UNM. “She took it on herself to teach me the ropes.”

Grey Canyon provided emotional support, but Smith wanted their art to be taken seriously. She sought places for them to exhibit and in 1979 landed their first show, at New York’s American Indian Community House. At the time, she was making pastels that referred to places that were meaningful to her. They look like enigmatic maps, with floating pictographs and tracks — Smith’s response to professors who emphasized abstraction. But when Grey Canyon exhibited at the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian in 1980, the members found that their modern paintings and abstract art clashed with some people’s stereotypical expectations of Native artists. Whitehorse recalled that white board members “hated it. They said, ‘What the heck are you doing? You should be at home, learning the craft your grandmothers are doing, making pottery and rugs.’”

Smith’s approach to organizing the Grey Canyon shows — cold-calling anywhere she could think of — established how she would go about much of her activism and curating for the next two decades: in a mode between seat-of-the-pants and “when the spirit moves me,” as her father would say.

Her improvisational urgency has had remarkable results. Her projects include helping to save Albuquerque’s Petroglyph National Monument and Santa Fe’s Institute of American Indian Arts. She’s also organized over 30 exhibitions, including important group shows of contemporary Native American photographers and women artists, and two exhibitions that rebutted the 1992 quincentennial celebrations of Columbus’s arrival in the Americas.

Such work reflects her communal mind-set — how she has expanded the space for Indigenous people in art by inviting others to give talks, connecting them to resources, or just writing notes of encouragement. “When I come through the door, I bring a community with me,” Smith said. “I want there to be others after me.” She attributes this to her heritage. “I’m still doing my dad’s horse trading,” she told me, only now what’s being exchanged are ideas and support.

Molly Donovan, the National Gallery’s curator of contemporary art, likened working with her to being “this lucky student in a pro seminar being taught by the pre-eminent voice on the subject. Jaune has a generous pedagogy; she freely shares her knowledge.”

Smith’s early solo gallery shows were in Santa Fe, then New York. She’s continued to exhibit regularly throughout her career, but has nonetheless felt relegated to the periphery: seen and heard but not always fully understood, her work written about but rarely in real depth.

“We’re marginalized,” she said, “and actually, there’s a certain comfort level in that. You don’t have to worry about bad PR, because nobody writes about it — nobody looks at it. So you can do whatever you want.”

In Smith’s case, that has meant honing her collage technique; introducing more icons, like the U.S. map and bison; and adjusting her colors and insistent strokes and drips of paint to better convey the clamorous contradictions of American Indian life. One potent painting, “Sovereign Nations” (2002), features three layered wingtip dresses decorated with American-flag stars (a nod to Jasper Johns’s “Three Flags” from 1958, hanging upstairs at the Whitney). They’re set against the text of the 1855 Treaty of Hellgate, which created the Flathead Reservation.

Part of what makes Smith’s practice fascinating is the tension it carries between her embrace of more Eurocentric, modernist methods and her pro-Indigenous, environmentalist, anticapitalist messages. Those messages feel very contemporary and of a piece with art by Nicholas Galanin, Maria Hupfield, and New Red Order, yet these younger Indigenous artists’ work is more formally experimental and often more direct.

“I’m caught between two generations,” Smith told me: that of her father, whose childhood experiences of being beaten at an American Indian boarding school made him feel like he “couldn’t say anything,” and that of younger Native artists, who “can say things that maybe we felt like we couldn’t,” Smith reflected, “I don’t think I have that freedom.”

It’s difficult to walk through her retrospective and reconcile that sentiment with what’s on view. Her canoe piled with skulls and flag with Mickey Mouse ears suggest that despite limitations or fear, she has found ways to say what she needs to. In a recent painting, she took the U.S. map and flipped it sideways. The move dispels the map’s authority, making it look precarious and absurd. In the center, amid yellows, reds and oranges, Smith added a cutout phrase that could serve as a secondhand manifesto: “NDN humor Causes people To survive.”

    "32" : """ There is a moment that has happened millions of times for eons, and yet has rarely been captured on film: a 12-year-old girl wondering what to do when she gets her period.

Judy Blume described it in print, in her seminal 1970 novel, “Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret.” More than a half-century later, the movie adaptation, due April 28, is putting that awkward puzzling-through onscreen, as young Margaret practices inserting a pad in her underwear. It’s a scene that is so quietly revolutionary, it made the movie’s editor cry when she first saw the footage.

There was just this sense, said the movie’s writer-director, Kelly Fremon Craig: “Oh my gosh, we have never been allowed to show this.”

Filming it “felt like some sort of release of the shame and embarrassment around it.”

Menstruation, burgeoning sexuality and fraught gender dynamics, religion, the barefoot-in-the-sprinkler joys and gossip-twisted tribulations of girlhood: “Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret” tracks it all, and has been both banned and beloved for it.

In the popular imagination, the book is mostly concerned with the changing body and the rites of puberty, and that’s what made it controversial. But Margaret’s exploration of religion — her Jewish father and Christian mother encourage her to decide for herself — also drew the ire of the religious right. The God Margaret confides in is nondenominational; as a preteen, she has agency and choice.

This 53-year-old story is landing in theaters squarely in the middle of today’s culture wars. The weightier issues it reflects, which had seemingly receded, are back at the forefront: overt antisemitism, the widespread curtailing of women’s reproductive rights, and a resurgence of book banning and censorship. “It’s worse than the ’80s,” when the author’s work was first targeted, “because of the way it’s coming from government,” Judy Blume said.

An era in which girls and women were held in an information vacuum — about their own bodies! — seems dangerously close to being resurrected. Even as children are starting puberty earlier, legislation currently advancing in the Republican-controlled House in Florida would effectively ban girls from even discussing their periods, according to the bill’s sponsor, until middle school. (The bill also limits sex education in general.)

“I’m worried,” Blume said, “that if we’re just complacent and laugh about it — like, that’s ridiculous, you can’t stop young girls from standing around in elementary school talking about periods. And it is laughable, and it would be great if it was just a joke. But it’s not.”

Blume, 85, has been active with the National Coalition Against Censorship for decades. Recently she felt ready to step back. “Now I feel I’m going to speak out every chance I get,” she told me.

WE WERE TALKING seaside in Key West, where Blume and her husband, George Cooper, run an independent nonprofit bookstore housed with a gallery space; Cooper, a retired law professor, also founded an indie movie theater. As a couple, they are a major cultural hub.

The theater held a benefit screening of “Margaret” that drew far-flung Blume fans like the radio personality Charlamagne tha God; lots of colorfully dressed locals; and a front row full of tween girls eager to meet Rachel McAdams, who plays Margaret’s mother. By the end of the night, they were clustering around Blume, said her friend Meg Cabot, the best-selling author of “The Princess Diaries.”

The movie, which stars Abby Ryder Fortson (“Transparent,” “Ant-Man”) as Margaret and Kathy Bates as her doting Manhattan glamma, is sweetly faithful to its source, down to the station wagons, wood-paneled basement mixers and coy names for feminine products.

Though the filmmakers may hope for multigenerational crowds, the film is not exactly for children. It’s for their parents, the Gen Xers and older millennials who grew up with Margaret — “the nostalgia audience,” Blume said.

Partly for their sake, Margaret’s mother got a new, expanded story line. “Of any project I’ve ever done, when I mention this one to people, they just light up,” McAdams told me in Key West. “They are so ready and excited to share their Judy Blume stories and connections, and how ‘Margaret’ just changed them, and how grateful they are for it.”

“Judy Blume books, you remember where you were when you read them and the feelings you had,” she added. “They’re just something that sticks with you.”

Treating taboo topics matter-of-factly, with emotional candor, is, of course, what has animated both Blume’s public profile and her writing for children and young adults — a whole generation-spanning oeuvre, with more than 90 million books sold worldwide and a phalanx of devoted (and high-profile) fans who tend to get weepy when they meet her.

Hollywood courted her regularly, but she was protective of her material, and it took a lesser known filmmaker, Fremon Craig, and her Oscar- and Emmy-winning mentor, James L. Brooks (“Broadcast News,” “The Simpsons”) to unlock the book.

It was Fremon Craig’s dream project, and she still got the jitters when it came time to write. “I felt like I was in the room with a bazillion Judy Blume fans, Judy Blume, my 12-year-old self — every single one of them just being like, ‘Don’t screw it up,’” she said. She banished the ghosts and took particular care with Margaret’s spiritual quest.

It was the most delicate part of the story, Fremon Craig said: reaching, at a young, tumultuous age, “for something greater, beyond yourself, in an effort to figure out if somebody is making sure you’re OK.”

“I actually think I was that age when I started to ask those larger existential questions,” she said. “And I feel like I still ask those questions every day.”

This is only her second feature, after the sharp coming-of-age comedy “The Edge of Seventeen,” which Blume loved enough to trust her with “Margaret.” Actually, the author has given the film more than her blessing; some of it, she told me, is even better than her original. In one climactic scene in the movie, all of Margaret’s grandparents meet to lay claim to her religious convictions. “I remember that I was afraid to do that in the book,” Blume said. “I didn’t know how to write a scene like that, with so many people talking over each other. And so I separated them.”

THE CULTURAL IMPACT of “Margaret” is hard to overstate, for inspiring individual readers and future writers and artists, and for detonating traditional ideas about what stories, and narrators, had value. A 

12-year-old musing about faith and aggressively wishing for bigger boobs changed the canon. “It is actually a really brave book,” said Corinne Demas, an author and professor emerita at Mount Holyoke College who taught Blume’s work. “She really said, ‘This stuff matters, and these people matter’ — and I think a lot of young girls hadn’t heard that message before, that they mattered.”

As Cabot put it: “Judy Blume is the Y.A. Philip Roth.”

They met more than 20 years ago, when Cabot first started writing young-adult fiction. “I just randomly got an email from Judy asking me over for lunch,” Cabot recalled. She had assembled a salon of Y.A. writers, all women, at her New York apartment; they bonded over their shared mission to empower girls in their writing.

Cabot eventually moved to Key West, too, and she marveled at Blume’s energy: greeting throngs of fans fresh off a cruise ship at her bookstore, where she works three or four days a week; riding her bike around town; tap-dancing; eating out enough that she has a pie named after her at a local pizzeria. In “Judy Blume Forever,” a documentary out this month, she says that after spending so many years cloistered behind a desk, she wants to be out in the world.

Bates hadn’t read her work before signing on to play Sylvia, the urbane grandmother, the kind who takes Margaret to Broadway shows and fancy lunches. (“The grandma I wanted,” Blume said.)

“I didn’t expect her to be so charming, and tiny, but very fashionable and madcap — she’s just delightful,” Bates said. “I wanted Sylvia to thrill her.” They talked about how to draw out the character; in the book, the adults are mostly ciphers seen through Margaret’s eyes. Fremon Craig gave them more back story, some of it freshly written by Blume, and some — especially for McAdams’s character, a painter who ultimately chafes at being a suburban housewife — from her own experience as a working mother.

“It was really, I think, key to making the movie, just making the mother a character and giving the mother her own journey,” Brooks, the film’s producer, said.

Blume, who has a producer credit, was on set for weeks at a time, including the day they filmed the scene with Margaret and her friends chanting the infamous refrain: “We must, we must, we must increase our bust!”

As choreographed by Fremon Craig, the girls were doing the accompanying moves wrong, Blume recalled — more of a prayer-hands squeeze inward. She whispered the note to a producer and then leaped up to show them how it’s done (a stretch outward, elbows down, chest, of course, projecting).

“MARGARET” IS BASED on some of her own experiences, including rehearsing what she’d need to do when her period arrived. “I practiced for a long time, because I was late,” Blume said. “I even pricked my finger to get some blood and put it on the pad, just to see what it would be like.”

Ryder Fortson filmed it when she was 13, so she was going through some of the same things as her character. Casting an adolescent meant “I was in a race against puberty,” Fremon Craig noted. (Puberty won. There was some CGI, and a scene in which Margaret tries on a bra actually features a boy standing in.)

It was “a vulnerable position to be in,” Ryder Fortson, now 15, said. But acting her way through the awkwardness while also experiencing it “made me accept it a little bit more,” she said. The daughter of two actors and the sibling of another, she moved with her entire family from Los Angeles to the shoot in North Carolina.

“Abby is an old soul, and she’s highly intelligent,” McAdams said. “I mean, she was reading ‘War and Peace’ on set.”

For the adult actors, revisiting adolescence alongside Margaret brought them back to the unease and confusion of that time. “I remember walking across in front of the Episcopal Church” and having someone explain penetrative sex, Bates, who is 74, said. “I just could not picture it; I couldn’t understand the physics involved.”

“I wish I had had better instruction, and better self-esteem that comes with that,” she said.

Every conversation I had with the women included a commiseration on the inadequacies of the feminine products aisle and on how much fear and humiliation there is around female sexuality. “My mother had me at 40,” Bates said. “She was embarrassed because it meant she was having sex at that age.”

“This film resonated on a very, very deep level with me,” she added, “on much larger issues, having to do with censoring oneself and not following the norm. The bottom line is, it’s extraordinary that this little girl is wise enough to think for herself.”

The movie is arriving during a teen mental health crisis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have sounded the alarm for girls, in particular, for whom social media and other factors have contributed to unparalleled turmoil. And yet, women and girls may still be better off than they were when “Margaret” was published and they were shrouded in darkness and shame about their own development.

“It did make me feel really grateful that I’m not growing up in the ’70s,” Ryder Fortson said. “The less communication there is, the less support that you have, the more terrible and confusing this time is.” The film, she added, “might be a great way to really show that talking about this is not bad. It’s actually a really, really good thing.”

Blume promised: “Oh, no, we’re not going back. No, no, no, no.”

    "33" : """ Book bans are rising at a rapid pace in school districts around the United States, driven by new laws and regulations that limit what kinds of books children can access, according to a new report from PEN America, a free speech organization.

From July to December 2022, PEN found 1,477 cases of books being removed, up from 1,149 during the previous six months. Since the organization began tracking bans in July 2021, it has counted more than 4,000 instances of book removals using news reports, public records requests and publicly available data.

The numbers don’t reflect the full scope of the efforts, since new mandates in some states requiring schools to vet all their reading material for potentially offensive content have led to mass removals of books, which PEN was unable to track, the report says.

The statistic also fails to capture the rapid evolution of book restrictions into what many free speech organizations consider a worrisome new phase: Book bans are increasingly driven by organized efforts led by elected officials or activists groups whose actions can affect a whole district or state.

Of the nearly 1,500 book removals that PEN tracked in the last six months of 2022, the majority — nearly 75 percent — were driven by organized efforts or because of new legislation.

Seven states, including Florida, Tennessee, Oklahoma and Utah, passed laws last year that impose limits on material in libraries, according to analysis done by EveryLibrary, a political action committee for libraries. This year, the group is tracking 113 bills across the country that it says would negatively impact libraries or curtail people’s freedom to read.

“This is much bigger than you can really count,” said Jonathan Friedman, the director of free expression and education at PEN America. “People need to understand that it’s not a single book being removed in a single school district, it’s a set of ideas that are under threat just about everywhere.”

PEN’s analysis follows similar findings by the American Library Association, which recently released a report showing that efforts to ban books nearly doubled in 2022 over the previous year, and reached the highest number of complaints since the association began studying censorship efforts more than 20 years ago. The association found that book challenges are now increasingly being filed against multiple titles at once. In the past, libraries and schools typically received complaints about a single work.

“We’ve had two record-breaking years, and those of us who are fighting book bans really have our work cut out for us,” said Christopher Finan, the executive director of the National Coalition Against Censorship. “At this point, we’re fighting an uphill battle.”

Free speech advocates are troubled by not just the sharp rise in book bans, but also the new ways in which books are being targeted. Until fairly recently, most book removals occurred when a parent raised concerns about a title with a teacher or librarian. Complaints were typically resolved quietly, after a school board or committee evaluated the material and determined whether it was appropriate for students.

That began to change during the pandemic, with the rise of groups like Moms for Liberty and Utah Parents United, which formed to oppose Covid-19 restrictions, began to focus on the content of school curriculums and libraries. Members of these groups started showing up at school board meetings to demand that certain books be removed and circulating online lists of titles they found objectionable.

The rise of these networks meant that specific books — often titles that center on L.G.B.T.Q. themes or that address racial inequality — were being targeted all over the country. The debate around what constitutes appropriate reading material for students also became increasingly politicized and vitriolic. Librarians and teachers have been accused of promoting pedophilia, and some have lost their jobs or quit under pressure after refusing to remove books.

PEN and other free speech groups say that the new laws have had a chilling effect.

In Florida, where the State Legislature passed a law requiring that a certified media specialist evaluate all the books on school classroom and library shelves, some districts advised schools to limit access to all the titles until they could vetted, resulting in empty library shelves in some schools. Similarly, after Tennessee passed the “Age Appropriate Materials Act,” which required schools to catalog all the books in their classrooms and libraries to ensure there was no inappropriate content, some teachers chose to remove or cover up their entire classroom libraries rather than risk violating the law.

This week, Tennessee lawmakers went further and passed a bill that would subject book publishers and distributors to criminal prosecution and hefty fines for providing public schools with material that is deemed to be obscene. In a statement, PEN called on Gov. Bill Lee to reject the bill, arguing that it serves no purpose other than to intimidate publishers into self-censorship.

PEN’s analysis tracked bans in 21 states, affecting 66 school districts, but found that book removals were concentrated in a handful of states. Texas had the highest number, with 438 removals, followed by Florida, with 357, then Missouri, where 315 books were banned, and Utah and South Carolina, which each saw more than 100 titles removed.

Many of the same titles are being targeted around the country. Among the most banned books last year were “Gender Queer” by Maia Kobabe, “Flamer” by Mike Curato, “Tricks” by Ellen Hopkins, a graphic novel edition of “The Handmaid’s Tale” by Margaret Atwood and “Milk and Honey,” a poetry collection by Rupi Kaur.

“I do fear we’re losing sight of just how unusual this is,” Friedman said. “Book bans are becoming normalized in many places.”

    "34" : """ In a new novella, “Death of an Author,” the writer, Aidan Marchine, describes a subpar plate of nachos this way:

“The cheese was congealed and the chips soggy, damp and smeared with a greasy film like some kind of lake scum. Gus forced himself to take a bite, but the flavor was rancid, a sickly sweet imitation of cheese. He washed it down with a swig of beer, but even that tasted ugly, like it had been sitting in the sun for too long.”

The writing is vivid, but there’s nothing particularly unusual about it. Aidan Marchine, however, is an unusual author — at least for now — because Aidan Marchine is a set of computer systems. Kind of.

The journalist and author Stephen Marche wrote “Death of an Author” using three artificial intelligence programs. Or three artificial intelligence programs wrote it with extensive plotting and prompting from Stephen Marche. It depends on how you look at it.

“I am the creator of this work, 100 percent,” Marche said, “but, on the other hand, I didn’t create the words.”

Pushkin Industries, an audio production company, will publish the novella next month as an audiobook and e-book. Even the moniker “Marchine” is an invention of a program, a combination of Marche and machine.

In January, Jacob Weisberg, Pushkin’s chief executive, approached Marche, who has been writing with and about artificial intelligence since 2017. He asked if Marche was interested in using the technology to produce a murder mystery. The result of that collaboration is “Death of Author,” in which an author who uses A.I. extensively winds up dead.

Whodunit? Was it her estranged daughter? Was it the professor of crime and cyberfiction who was an expert on her work? Was it the eccentric billionaire who worked with her on a secretive A.I. project?

To coax the story from his laptop, Marche used three programs, starting with ChatGPT. He ran an outline of the plot through the software, along with numerous prompts and notes. While A.I. was good at many things, especially dialogue, he said, its plots were terrible.

Next, he used Sudowrite, asking the program to make a sentence longer or shorter, to adopt a more conversational tone or to make the writing sound like Ernest Hemingway’s. Then he used Cohere to create what he called the best lines in the book. If he wanted to describe the smell of coffee, he trained the program with examples and then asked it to generate similes until he found one he liked.

“To me, the process was a bit akin to hip-hop,” he said. “If you’re making hip-hop, you don’t necessarily know how to drum, but you definitely need to know how beats work, how hooks work, and you need to be able to put them together in a meaningful way.”

Marche said that these programs could be a tool for writers, and he declared himself optimistic about the growth of algorithmic writing in his field. But the prospect makes many writers and their representatives extremely nervous, worried that machines will put writers out of a job. The Authors Guild has called for “legal and policy interventions that balance development of useful A.I. tools with protection of human authorship.”

Weisberg, the chief executive of Pushkin, said that while new tools very often displaced people, they also created opportunities. Take journalism, for example.

“If routine news stories are drafted or generated by technology,” he said, “you, as a journalist, instead of reporting on every fire, can write interesting news stories about A.I.”

Marche and Pushkin tried to use software to create as much of “Death of an Author” as possible, including blurbs and its cover art. But there was one area in which its creators felt the technology was lacking: narration for the audiobook. So they hired a human, Edoardo Ballerini, who has won several awards in the field.

“But this stuff is moving so fast,” Weisberg said. “If we were doing it now as opposed to six weeks ago, I think we could get A.I. narration that would be up to snuff.”

    "35" : """ Season 3, Episode 10: ‘The Last Generation’

“What began over 35 years ago ends tonight,” Jean-Luc Picard says, standing on his favorite bridge and glaring at his most distasteful enemy. It recalled his “The line must be drawn here!” from “First Contact.”

This was ostensibly a reference to the Federation’s longstanding battle with the Borg, but it also applies to “The Next Generation” franchise. (The show began airing in 1987 and 35 years ago would be 1988.) And if this is the last time we see these characters, that’s OK. Not because this season of “Picard” wasn’t a strong one. Quite the opposite, in fact: It was quite good and recaptured everything that made “Next Generation” what it was.

The characters all used special skills to work together and save humankind. Some of the dialogue was campy. There were plot holes. And there were classic “Star Trek” tropes, like Jean-Luc nonsensically going to the Borg cube, when he was likely the least physically capable of the old crew in fighting off the Borg.

But overall, this season was a worthy send-off for the crew. It wasn’t perfect, but neither were the show or any of the movies. But it was worth doing. The story justified its existence, advancing each of the main characters and filling in some gaps.
And it confirmed one last time that “The Next Generation” was greater than the sum of its parts. That might have been why the first two seasons of “Picard” didn’t work as well. Jean-Luc wasn’t the best character he could be without his old friends. The chemistry wasn’t as fluid, and the story wasn’t as deep.

In the finale, we learn a bit about what the Borg have been up to, though I remain baffled that no one brings up Jurati or the whole Good Borg thing from last season. (Maybe it was for the best.) There was no collective left — only the Borg Queen remained, she claimed, though we know from last season’s events that this isn’t exactly true.

It was Jack who found the Borg Queen, at least in her telling. She speaks in a way that is contrary to what we’ve known about the Borg: She says she was lonely and that the Borg were left to starve. (This kind of undercuts the Borg’s whole message of being the perfect beings.) But now, the Borg want to evolve rather than assimilate, and Jack is the perfect partner to do that. (In order to survive, the Borg Queen, I think, resorted to Borg cannibalism. Yikes! Hope those drones won Employee of the Month or something.)

The Borg and the changelings came to an agreement in which the changelings would be the Borg’s vehicle to carry out some villainous plan to help them procreate. Aside from an ill-fated revenge that they didn’t really need the Borg for, I don’t know what the changelings really got out of this alliance.

Elsewhere, classic Star Trekking happens. Worf and Riker fight off some baddies on the cube. Beverly uses her now finely honed combat skills to fire weapons. (It’s somewhat amusing that Geordi refurbished the Enterprise D for display at the fleet museum and also included a loaded torpedo system. Thank goodness he went above and beyond!) Data shows off his lightning fast piloting skills, assisted by his newly acquired gut instinct.

Beverly is faced with an impossible decision: Blow up her son and save the galaxy, or, uh, don’t. I loved that Geordi is the one who asks her permission, because he now understands a parent’s love for a child. And when it comes time to fire on the beacon, Geordi really, really doesn’t want to do it.

Jean-Luc finds another solution. He assimilates himself so he can get in contact with Jack in the Borg collective. Jean-Luc isn’t human, of course. He is an android — apparently, he can just plug himself in to the network like a flash drive. Jean-Luc tells Jack that he is the missing part of Jean-Luc’s life. (Patrick Stewart plays this perfectly.)

Jean-Luc is finally able to admit to himself how lonely he was outside of Starfleet, and that Starfleet merely covered up that loneliness rather than filling it entirely. Jean-Luc gives his son something he’s craved his whole life: approval and unconditional love. And Jean-Luc also won’t let his son go. He offers to stay in the hole with him so they can climb out together, and Jean-Luc gets to be the father he never knew he wanted to be.

Eventually, Jean-Luc pushes Jack to unassimilate himself and turn against the Queen. And that’s that: The universe is saved again. Our thanks to the crew of the Enterprise for the umpteenth time.

The episode ends in the only appropriate way for the “Next Generation” crew: They sit around and toast one another. Jean-Luc quotes Shakespeare, and then they whoop and play cards just like at the end of “All Good Things…,” the series finale of the original “Next Generation.”

The end wasn’t perfect, but it was proper. And that’s about all you can ask from a season like this. I don’t need any more — I want the Enterprise D crew to Costanza it and leave on a high note. They’ve earned it.

Odds and ends

Somewhat amusingly, Jean-Luc does not express any concern for or otherwise mention Laris throughout this season, another example of the team behind “Picard” trying to erase the first two seasons of the show from existence. But Laris, for her part, actually appeared in the season premiere and, one could argue, help put the events of the reunion in motion.

I keep thinking about that scene early this season with Riker and Jean-Luc at the bar, when Riker has to defend the honor of the Enterprise D. We didn't know it then, but that foreshadowed the whole season.

I would have liked to hear more about what Worf has been up to since the events of “Nemesis.” At the end of “Deep Space Nine,” Worf was named an ambassador to Qo’noS. In “Nemesis,” Worf somehow just becomes a member of the Enterprise crew again with little explanation. In this season, it is implied that Worf helped destroy the Enterprise E — more detail would have been nice.

The “Worf as comic relief” thing, as when he fell asleep on the bridge immediately after he helps to save civilization, also wore thin. But there is a fun callback in the last scene of the episode: Beverly saying Worf should have another glass of prune juice. A warrior’s drink!

Pavel Chekov’s son, Anton, being president of the Federation was a nice touch. Anton is likely a reference to Anton Yelchin, who played Chekov in the rebooted feature films beginning in 2009. He died in 2016 as a result of a car accident.

When Seven and Raffi figure out a way to transport assimilated crew members off the bridge using phaser rifles, it’s quite the deus ex machina. That technology would’ve been helpful all season!

That was a funny moment when the cook is ordered to pilot the Titan. He didn’t even finish flight training, why is Seven making him take the wheel? Have Raffi do it! (Within minutes, the cook executes complicated evasive maneuvers, so that must have been some training.)

At first, I found New Data to be jarring but after a couple episodes, this version grew on me. When he says he hates the Borg, you can see the Lore side of him burst through. It’s a fresh take on Data and Brent Spiner pulls it off.

That was a nice bit of wordless acting from Jonathan Frakes and Marina Sirtis when Riker heads down to the cube for yet another mission with Jean-Luc. The swashbuckling Riker gives the slightest of smiles, as if to say, “You know who you married. You know why I have to do this.” And Troi reluctantly agrees. Later, when Troi tells Riker he will only have a minute or so to save Jean-Luc once the Enterprise fires on the Cube, he responds again with cool confidence in a near death situation.

There will certainly be some disappointment among fans that Kate Mulgrew did not reprise her role as Admiral Janeway this season. The events in “Voyager” presumably are the reason the Borg cube was in such terrible shape when Jean-Luc beams aboard. Given the multiple references to Janeway and what was happening on Earth, it would have been nice to have gotten a glimpse of her. (And man, how gnarly does the Borg Queen look now?)

Ah, there’s Tuvok, offering Seven her own ship. As Vulcan as ever.

In the grand scheme of things, this is still only the second most successful attack by the Borg on Earth. Sure, they get to Earth, bring down the planetary defense systems and attack cities directly, all while using Starfleet ships. But in “First Contact,” they actually went back in time and assimilated all of Earth before the pesky Enterprise crew initiated a do-over. And honestly, if Jean-Luc and his merry band hasn’t been able to rescue Earth from Evil Jack, they could have just done what they did last season or in “First Contact”: Go back in time. It’s easy!

Troi gets to drive the Enterprise D again. It went better than it did last time, when she crashed it.

Beverly is an admiral now? What a promotion, considering the decades she spent out of Starfleet running a rogue operation. I wonder if Riker, Geordi or any of the others were like, “Hey, what about us?”

Ed Speleers did an admirable job as Jack Crusher. It’s not easy to go toe-to-toe with Patrick Stewart, but Speleers fits in seamlessly as Beverly and Jean-Luc’s son. (While we’re here, what’s up with Jack’s brother, Wesley?)

I hope all of you stuck around for the post-credits scene. Q is still alive! Of course he is. We don’t acknowledge last season around these parts.

    "36" : """ Judging from “Little Richard: I Am Everything,” the best way to understand the self-proclaimed “architect of rock ’n’ roll” is through his contradictions.

In this documentary, directed by Lisa Cortés, Little Richard, who died in 2020, is seen as a musician who could simultaneously lay the groundwork for an entire genre and not get his due. Without him, we probably wouldn’t have the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, David Bowie or Prince — artists who were happy to cite his influence even as they stole his thunder and his style.

In the 1950s, he broke with the slower sounds of Ray Charles and B.B. King in favor of fast songs with lyrics not so subtly about sex. Yet over the years he seemed to have a conflicted relationship with his own sexuality. (He is shown in an early 1980s interview with David Letterman claiming both that he believed he was one of the first gay people to come out and that he was no longer gay.) He went from flamboyant rocker to gospel singer and back again.

“He was very, very good at liberating other people through his example,” the pop-music scholar Jason King says in the film. “He was not good at liberating himself.”

Mick Jagger, who credits Little Richard with teaching him how to work the whole stage, and John Waters, who says his mustache is a tribute, are among the famous faces here who testify to how he liberated them. “I Am Everything” also skews gratifyingly wonky for a pop-music bio-doc. The sociologist Zandria Robinson describes the cultural atmosphere in the South — a space, she says, for the different, the Gothic and the nonnormative — at the time Richard was formed as an artist. King describes Little Richard’s piano playing as a left hand of boogie-woogie and a right hand of Ike Turner-influenced percussion.

Little Richard himself, seen in a bounty of archival footage, gives good quotes — “everybody likes to go to orgies,” he says at one point. And even in decades-old video, his musical performances, like a rendition of “I Can’t Turn You Loose” at the 1989 induction of Otis Redding to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, are showstoppers.

Cortés tries a few things to upend the humdrum rock-doc template. She has musicians re-create breakout moments in Little Richard’s career, such as a night in the 1940s when Sister Rosetta Tharpe had him take the stage in Macon, Ga., or a spontaneous rendition of “Tutti Frutti,” before its lyrics were sanitized, at the Dew Drop Inn in New Orleans. (A montage depicts the song’s popularity as a cosmic explosion, even as Little Richard is shown complaining bitterly in an interview that Elvis and Pat Boone “sold more of ‘Tutti Frutti’ than I did.”) At the end of the day, though, “I Am Everything” is content to be a thorough, energetic, largely chronological appraisal, more interested in saluting a musical legend who shook things up than in shaking up conventions itself.

    "37": """ You can’t have “Carmen” without the color red.

In the choreographer Benjamin Millepied’s debut film — an adaptation of the classic story, previously told in prose by Prosper Mérrimée and more famously in opera by Georges Bizet — it’s there from the start, in the opening titles, the pedals of a rose, the title heroine’s shirt.

But nothing more than color signifies that this is a “Carmen” tale, that old psychosexual drama of a male soldier so seduced by a Spanish femme fatale, he forgets his duties and is driven to jealousy and murder. No, here Carmen is instead a young Mexican woman both headstrong and naïve, restless and searching — much like the film itself.

That is disappointing for a movie seemingly assembled from promise: in Millepied, an enterprising dance-maker who pioneered small-screen performance during the pandemic; in Nicholas Britell, a composer of knockout, earworm-rich soundtracks; in Rossy de Palma, an alluring, otherworldly fixture of Pedro Almodóvar films; and in Paul Mescal, a fast-rising, Oscar-nominated star capable of conveying swaths of biography and feeling in a sadly handsome smile.

They make for a film with elements of dance on camera, musical, of-the-moment melodrama and visual poetry — but without a thorough commitment to any one of those and few, if any, moments of coalescence. The screenplay is spare to the point of meager; characters speak in clichés, like claiming that music won’t pay the bills, and are divided, boringly, into categories of unequivocally good (Mexican immigrants mainly) and bad (all white characters except Mescal’s Aidan).

No dialogue, anyway, communicates more effectively than Britell’s soundtrack, a constant presence, tense and evocative, functioning like opera by fully integrating with, if not driving, the story rather than underscoring it. The movie also says more through movement than speech: percussive flamenco; climactic krumping in a fight sequence starring and set to an original song by the D.O.C.; a touching pas de deux of Carmen’s balletic fluidity and Aidan’s awkward, failing attempts to match her.

Little seems to keep this couple of lost souls — he a tormented war vet, she an undocumented Mexican immigrant on the run — together other than fear. As Carmen, Melissa Barrera is beautiful but somewhat blank, an obtuse mystery next to Mescal, his face having the shape and solemnity of a Roman statue, but eyes that repeatedly betray his pain. De Palma is a welcome source of levity as Masilda, a nightclub owner who tells Aidan that if she were younger she would eat him up like a plate of chilaquiles.

Masilda tells Carmen that her name means poem, that she is “the most beautiful poem made into a woman.” Yet much of the film’s poetry comes from the cinematography of Jörg Widmer — a veteran of Terrence Malick’s sweeping, awe-struck camera gestures — who renders a desert landscape expansive and entrapping, and finds wonder in the otherwise stressful tangle of Los Angeles freeways. Millepied relishes close-ups of bodies in motion, and scatters dreamy symbolism throughout the story, populating his world with angels of death.

Carmen and Aidan are connected, before they meet, by small flames that rise spontaneously from the ground. In the end, they are separated by tragedy. Their trajectory couldn’t be simpler, but this film, at nearly two aimless hours, doesn’t seem interested in, or capable of, that kind of focus.

    "38" : """ In the lurid 1973 dystopian thriller “Soylent Green,” Edward G. Robinson movingly played a man who embraced euthanasia, dying in a special chamber while being soothed by classical music. That story was set in 2022. “Plan 75,” the quietly bold debut feature of Chie Hayakawa, is on the same page, envisioning a more or less present-day version of Japan that hawks euthanasia services to the aged.

As macabre as that sounds, the conceit channels actual anxieties in Japan about providing for a growing population of seniors. The sober drama centers on a 78-year-old woman, Michi (Chieko Baisho), who still has her independence, her health and a karaoke-loving friend circle.

The government’s assisted suicide program seems like an over-advertised nuisance to Michi, until she loses her job and finds a friend slumped over dead. Life turns precarious, Michi grows isolated and Plan 75 — the name of the government program — starts to sounds appealing. We are also introduced to a Plan 75 clerk, Hiromu (Hayato Isomura), and a Filipino caretaker, Maria (Stefanie Arianne), who takes an unsavory gig with the program.

Hayakawa avoids slipping into satire or a stylized dystopia, making details like a euthanasia spa package seem plausible (and insidious). Yet a somnolence hangs over the film, and Hiromu and Maria are left somewhere between having full-fledged story lines and just being useful foils. Still, Baisho gets across the creeping despair that morbidity and the loss of community can create — a sensation that lets “Plan 75” double as a consummate entry in pandemic-era cinema.

    "39" : """ “Trenque Lauquen,” a wondrous multipart epic from the Argentine director Laura Citarella, opens with men on a quest. Laura (Laura Paredes), a visiting botanist working on research in Trenque Lauquen, a town southwest of Buenos Aires, has disappeared, leaving only a cryptic note behind: “Farewell, farewell. I’m leaving, I’m leaving.” Rafael (Rafael Spregelburd), Laura’s boyfriend, and Ezequiel (Ezequiel Pierri), her research colleague turned almost-lover, drive through the countryside, seeking her traces.

As the film unfolds across twelve chapters (split into two feature-length parts), the men’s pursuit grows like a wild, proliferating vine: Missing women multiply, and the film’s mysteries fork into new ciphers. Yet it’s only in the seventh chapter that someone questions the very premise of the search for Laura, asking Ezequiel, “What makes you think she wants to be found?”

“Trenque Lauquen” undermines the hubris of discovery — a distinctly masculine impulse, and a narrative principle we often take for granted. Produced by El Pampero Cine, an Argentine production company known for sprawling, Borgesian films like the more than 13-hour “La Flor” (2019), Citarella’s film posits that being lost can be a kind of liberation, and that mystery, in movies, can be an end in itself, rather than a path to a revelation. The first, six-chapter part alternates between two timelines and two quests: Rafael and Ezequiel’s search for Laura, and flashbacks to Ezequiel and Laura’s attempts to track down the identity of Carmen Zuna (played in fantasy sequences by Citarella), a schoolteacher who had a passionate affair with a local landowner in the 1960s. Laura finds their erotic love letters hidden away in books at the library and becomes enamored, her passion soon infecting Ezequiel.

The second chapter starts to illuminate the circumstances behind Laura’s disappearance, only to unwrap an entirely new puzzle: this time about two lesbian lovers in the suburbs who seem to be conducting a scientific experiment, secretly raising a mutant creature. Frankenstein comes to mind here and also as a metaphor for the film’s patchwork structure. Relayed through letters and notes in the first half, and Laura’s voice-over in the second, the many micro-stories that make up the narrative seem to take on lives of their own, crisscrossing and diverging unexpectedly. Familiar hints of horror and detective stories appear like red herrings, but the ultimate effect is of a campfire tale: The pleasure lies in the telling — the invention of fictions, the performance of emotions — rather than in the details of plot. Once you lose yourself in the thickets of “Trenque Lauquen,” you won’t want to be found.

    "40" : """ There are few living children’s authors who have connected as deeply to their readers as Judy Blume. That’s the argument of “Judy Blume Forever,” a new documentary from Davina Pardo and Leah Wolchok that pays unwavering tribute to Blume and her imprint on young adult literature. The film, streaming on Amazon Prime Video starting Friday, features the 85-year-old writer narrating the major milestones of her life and career, cut together with interviews of famous Blume acolytes such as the writer and director Lena Dunham, the comedian Samantha Bee, the writer Jacqueline Woodson and Anna Konkle, the co-creator of “PEN15.”

Since the publication of her breakthrough novel “Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret,” in 1970, while she was a young housewife in suburban New Jersey, Blume has maintained a fiercely devoted audience that has found enlightenment and understanding through her preteen and teenage characters. It’s not uncommon to hear fans of Blume’s work say that reading her books felt as though she was speaking directly to them through the pages. This is thanks, in no small part, to her frank discussion of mature themes that, at the time she was writing, were considered unusual for what we now call Y.A. novels: adolescent sexuality, religion, disability, bullying, and — in many of her books — the unfair expectations of purity and obedience that parents and society place on children.

“Judy Blume Forever” does a fine job of synthesizing the influences that Blume’s life had on her writing — in particular her father’s death when she was 21, as well as the marriage and divorce that inspired her first adult-oriented novel, “Wifey.” Blume, a longtime free-speech advocate, also has no qualms about drawing parallels between the Reagan-era book censorship campaigns she endured and the hundreds of attempts to ban books in just the past year.

In a successful showcase of what might be lost if Blume’s books were removed from libraries and schools, the film returns to one of the most compelling aspects of career: her correspondence with thousands of children, whose letters to her span 50 years and are now archived at Yale. Pardo and Wolchok interview two of Blume’s pen pals, now adults themselves, and their recounting of her impact on their lives encompasses some of the film’s most moving portions.

At times, “Judy Blume Forever” can resemble a highlight reel of Blume’s bibliography, with large sections dedicated to her books’ most memorable excerpts, such as the masturbation sequence in “Deenie.” Given her vast literary output, it’s hard to give complex stories like “Blubber” and “Forever” the nuance they deserve in a short documentary, especially one this preoccupied with showing Judy Blume the person, jogging on the beach and owning a small bookstore in Key West. Compared with her most obvious predecessor, Maurice Sendak, who led an intensely private life, Blume has always been an open book, despite the flurry of controversy around her. That may not make for the most exciting documentary, but it does make Blume herself even more endearing.

    "41" : """ You’ve heard of Quasimodo, the hunchback of Notre Dame, the actor Brian Cox announces at the start of “Quasi,” but you haven’t heard this version. And maybe you shouldn’t — unless, that is, you’re in a certain state of mind at a certain time of night. In “Quasi,” the latest film from the comedy troupe Broken Lizard, the disfigured peasant from the famed Victor Hugo novel is working in medieval torture chambers when he’s suddenly thrust into a web of murderous royal intrigue.

After the queen of France (Adrianne Palicki) takes a liking to Quasi, he finds himself at a dinner with the obnoxious king (Jay Chandrasekhar), who asks him to assassinate the pope (Paul Soter), a longtime rival. During the attempt, though, the pope asks Quasi to kill the king, leaving the hunchback in a bind.

The high-stakes political affair takes place with the goofy, lighthearted energy you’d expect from the comedy group behind “Super Troopers” and “Beerfest” (“Quasi” is directed by Kevin Heffernan, who stars in the film alongside the rest of the Broken Lizard troupe): It’s dumb fun that is at times entertaining, at times flat.

At the heart of this film is a thematic twist that would be at home in a Seth Rogen movie: a repressed bromance between Quasi and his “hut-mate,” Duchamp (Heffernan), both of whom refuse to admit they’re each other’s best friends. The parodic period-piece framework lends an added layer of whimsy and offbeat jokes to the Broken Lizard sensibility — though that is perhaps not enough to justify a film that can, at times, feel like a so-so sketch that didn’t warrant a feature. But you’ll most likely get a few laughs and mild enjoyment when you just surrender yourself to the inanity of it all.

    "42" : """ Someday, when conventional wisdom gives way to common sense, “Everybody Loves Raymond” will be recognized as one of the best network situation comedies. Incisively written and superbly acted, it explored with surgical precision the bottomless hostility animating passive-aggressive family dynamics. Ray Romano, whose standup comedy fueled the series’ themes, very successfully bridged the skill set of a standup comedian with that of an ensemble comedic actor. And yet. No respect, or not enough respect.

In any event, the series is now a thing of the past, and Romano is taking a turn behind the camera for his feature directing debut, “Somewhere in Queens,” which he co-wrote with Mark Stegemann. Here, Romano sticks to the outer-borough Italian American milieu of his series. The results are mixed.

Romano plays Leo Russo, a likable, “Rocky”-obsessed screw-up who’s the underdog of his dad’s family construction firm. His tough cookie wife, Angela (Laurie Metcalf), is recovering from cancer. Their only son, nicknamed Sticks (Jacob Ward), is recessively shy but fiercely talented at basketball. His gift might yield him a college scholarship and has already attracted Dani (Sadie Stanley), a free-spirited girl.

But when Sticks crowds Dani, things cool between the two. Leo, in a fit of desperation, approaches Dani with an appalling proposition that will continue the momentum of the young couple’s relationship and keep Sticks on track for his college tryout.

This genuinely discomfiting narrative material hits some raw nerves, and the cast, which also includes the great Tony Lo Bianco, doesn’t back down from emotional authenticity. But if you’ve been following the movie’s music choices, which contain a number of songs that are at least wet-noodle adjacent, you won’t be surprised that Romano eventually contrives soft, and arguably goofy, exits for his troubled characters.

    "43" : """ No royal heir in British history has waited longer than Charles III, the king formerly known as the Prince of Wales, to ascend the throne. When he is officially crowned, on May 6, Charles will be 74 years old — a full 47 years older than his mother, Elizabeth II, was at her own coronation way back in the mid-20th century.

A lot has changed in the monarchy, and in the monarch, since the early days of the queen’s reign. Elizabeth came to the top job through accidents of history and fate. Her uncle, Edward VIII, abdicated in 1936, disrupting the normal order of succession; her father, George VI, succeeded him but died 16 years later at the age of 56, propelling Elizabeth onto the throne. By contrast, Charles — the oldest Prince of Wales in British history to become king — was born a monarch-in-waiting and has had a lifetime to prepare.

The public in turn has had a lifetime to get to know Charles, starting from his rarefied childhood in the public eye. We had a ringside seat at his marriage to Diana, Princess of Wales, who died in 1997; we followed his affair with and eventual marriage to Camilla Parker Bowles; we saw his struggles with his second son, Prince Harry, in an ongoing saga that is bound to spill over into the coronation, which Harry is scheduled to attend without his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.

By tradition, heirs to the throne don’t meddle in unroyal matters. But Charles was an unusually outspoken Prince of Wales. He is known as a lover of classical music, a student of philosophy and world religions and a proponent of sometimes controversial ideas. He has often waded into debates on unexpected topics like alternative medicine and organic farming (pro) and modernist architecture (against).

In London alone, there are plenty of royal spots to visit (Kensington Palace and Westminster Abbey, for starters), royal-themed exhibits to explore (“The Royal Palace Experience” at Madame Tussauds) and coronation-themed walking tours through this most inviting of cities.

But for visitors interested in exploring the history and psyche of the new king, here are some stops on an alternative royal tour in and around the city.

Highgrove

Charles bought Highgrove House, a Georgian neo-Classical estate in Gloucestershire, in 1980, before he married Diana. He saw it as a refuge, a bolt-hole in which he could pursue country pleasures and contemplate the beauty of nature; she found it boring and preferred the city. More and more, it became the place where he arranged discreet trysts with Camilla Parker Bowles.

The house — reachable by bus from London, or by taking a train to Kemble, and then a taxi — is closed to outsiders. But the grounds are open for tours each April through October. Until the end of May, there’s also an exhibition at the Garrison Chapel in Chelsea, London, “Highgrove in Harmony: Exploring A Royal Vision,” that lets you appreciate the gardens without leaving the city.

The exhibition demonstrates how fully the gardens embody Charles’s philosophical and aesthetic preoccupations: his love of nature, his passion for tradition, his enthusiasm for artisanal crafts. There’s a winsome photo of him on his knees weeding, and several never-before-seen princely watercolors and sketches. Charles is said to have even personally planted much of the thyme in what is known as the Thyme Walk.

The gardens consist of a number of interconnected parts and you can see photographs of them all here, including the flower-dotted Wildflower Meadow, which Charles envisioned as imitating “the foreground in Botticelli’s great painting ‘Primavera.’” It’s farmed using traditional methods — scythed by hand and visited each autumn by Shropshire sheep. As Charles once said: “I never underestimate the value of the ‘golden hoof’ in the great scheme of biodiversity.”

Trinity College, Cambridge

When Charles was still an unhappy student in a remote Scottish boarding school, a high-level committee decreed that, in a break with tradition, he should continue his education instead of going directly into the military. Thus he became the first Prince of Wales ever to receive a university degree.

The young prince was sent to Trinity, the richest of Cambridge University’s 31 colleges. His life there was hardly normal. Isolated by temperament and position from most of the other students, Charles frequently repaired to the countryside for shooting weekends and to London for cultural and state functions. (He also studied for some months in Wales in preparation for his formal investiture as Prince of Wales at Caernarfon Castle, a medieval fortress in northwest Wales.) According to a contemporary report in The Times, Charles did give student life a go. He sang, acted, contributed to the university magazine, played polo against Oxford, took an evening pottery course and went on an archaeological dig with other students to the island of Jersey.

You can visit the princely academic habitat by taking the hour-or-so-long train ride from London to Cambridge; Trinity is a short cab ride into town. Founded by Henry VIII in 1546, the college is impressively grand, due in part to its reported 1.3 billion pounds in assets. (Its holdings include the O2 Arena in London and great swaths of the busy and lucrative Port of Felixstowe.)

Since the pandemic, Trinity’s awe-inspiring interior — including the Great Court; a famous statue of Henry VIII holding a chair leg that at some point replaced his original sword; and the library designed by Sir Christopher Wren and dating to 1695 — has, sadly, been closed to the public. But visitors can approach from the back, walking along a network of college-owned lawns across the Cam River, and peer in through the formidable gates. There the college porters, resplendent in bowler hats, will be happy to share royal and other tidbits.

The British Library

Charles, a devotee of traditional building materials and traditional buildings, has spent many years attacking what he sees as the scourge of modernist architecture. In 1984, he managed to offend many members of the London architectural establishment by denouncing their work in a speech to the Royal Institute of British Architects.

His interventions had a knock-on effect, causing the cancellation of some of the buildings he singled out for particular scorn. Some of the casualties: a planned extension to the National Gallery, which Charles compared to a “monstrous carbuncle”; a Mies van der Rohe-designed building that he called “a giant glass stump”; and three projects by Richard Rogers, the modernist architect who died in 2021. “You have to give this much to the Luftwaffe,” Charles said, referring to one of Mr. Rogers’s proposals. “When it knocked down our buildings, it didn’t replace them with anything more offensive than rubble.”

Charles’s biggest bête noire was the British Library, an epic project designed by the architect Colin St. John Wilson that cost more than $700 million and took 36 years from inception to completion, and that he said looked like a “dim collection of sheds groping for some symbolic significance.” (For good measure, he compared its reading room to “the assembly hall of an academy for secret police.”)

The library opened in 1998 and was an instant hit, though most people agree that the building’s pedestrian red brick exterior does a disservice to the majestic interior, with its cunning deployment of multiple levels, soaring spaces and beautiful use of light. Its centerpiece is the King’s Library, a leather- and vellum-bound collection that rises up in a six-story glass bookcase at the building’s core.

The library is now a buzzy and vibrant cultural center thrumming with life. Some of its greatest treasures are displayed in its dedicated exhibition space. (Asked for a recommendation on a recent visit, a staff member said he quite liked the Magna Carta.)

Mr. St. John Wilson never really recovered from all the criticism, though he was knighted in 1998. He died in 2007, at 85. Eight years later, the library was designated a Grade I-listed building, Britain’s highest heritage honor.

The Ritz

London is full of Charles-related locations, as you might expect. There is Clarence House, where he and soon-to-be-crowned Queen Camilla lived for many years. There is Hill House in West London, where he went to elementary school, and the Tower of London, where many of his family’s jewels are on display. (It’s currently without the Imperial State Crown and Queen Mary’s Crown, which are being used in the coronation.)

And there is the Ritz hotel, the scene of the historic occasion when Charles and Camilla emerged from the shadows of their extramarital affair and appeared in public as a couple for the first time. All they did was leave a party and briefly stand outside. But this was the moment, as The Independent newspaper put it at the time, when “15 seconds of blinding flashbulbs ended at least 12 years of ducking and diving.”

The year was 1999, four years after Diana threw a grenade into the royal myth by declaring that “there were three of us in this marriage” — meaning she, Charles and Camilla. The couple divorced in 1996; Diana’s fatal car accident took place the following summer. The appearance at the Ritz was the beginning of Camilla’s integration into Charles’s public life, culminating in the couple’s marriage, in 2005.

The Ritz is as stately a venue for a romantic coming-out as it is possible to be. Situated on the corner of Green Park on Piccadilly, it evokes old-school opulence and over-the-top obsequious hospitality.

Nonroyal visitors can eat in the Michelin-starred restaurant (sample dinner entree: Dover sole for 68 pounds, or about $85); sip cocktails at the Rivoli Bar, or take afternoon tea, for 70 pounds apiece, in the grand foyer. Pro tip: Wear something nice, get a good blowout and leave your fanny pack at home. However you look, you will feel frumpy compared to everyone else.

Poundbury

Nestled at one end of Dorchester in Dorset, southwest England, Poundbury is the embodiment of the king’s singular Weltanschauung, a community built from scratch on 400 acres of farmland owned by the Duchy of Cornwall, the royal estate. With some 4,600 residents, it’s a royal experiment in contemporary living meant to “break the mold of conventional housing,” Charles once said.

Poundbury’s central hub is named Queen Mother Square, after Charles’s late grandmother; the main pub-cum-hotel is called the Duchess of Cornwall Inn, after his wife. But mostly the town is an exercise in soft-power royalty. The traditional building materials, the human-scale architecture, the master plan by the modernist-eschewing Luxembourgish architect Léon Krier, the harmonious aesthetic in the prettily painted front doors, the artisanal shops — all these reflect Charles’s values and philosophy.

Take the train to Dorchester South, hop on a bus to Poundbury and disembark at the square, identifiable by the huge Queen Mother statue. Walk down the street in any direction to get the feel of the place.

Here classic townhouses intermingle with apartment buildings and free-standing one-family homes, interspersed with squares, tiny parks and cunningly constructed courtyards and alleys that convey an air of openness and connection. There is no litter. There are few pedestrians and very little noise.

Poundbury’s residents are zealous converts to this way of living. Outsiders have been less enthusiastic. The town has been compared to a Potemkin village, to Brigadoon, to a “feudal Disneyland” and to the town in the movie “The Truman Show.”

To judge for yourself, shop at the garden center for flowers and horticultural accouterments. Eat at one of the quaint nearby cafes, like the Potting Shed, with its many sorts of olives. Buy some artisanal bread at Finca in a grand building known as the Buttercross, catch up on town gossip at the Buttermarket convenience store, which doubles as the post office, or indulge in a spa treatment at Pure Beauty.

Farther afield

You won’t find Charles featured on the website of Gordonstoun, the remote Scottish boarding school his father, Prince Philip, forced him to attend and which he once referred to as “Colditz in kilts,” referring to the prisoner-of-war camp run by the Nazis. But it happens to be surrounded by extraordinarily beautiful (if often wet and cold) countryside, and is near, among other things, the lovely 13th-century market town of Elgin.

As befitting his former role as Prince of Wales, Charles has a residence in Wales: Llwynywermod, near Mydffai, a tiny village near the Brecon Beacons National Park. It’s closed to the public, but visitors really yearning for royal experiences can choose from two vacation cottages — North Range and West Range — available for rent on the property.

    "44" : """ Mentor-mentee relationships have nourished generations of artists, especially those who were not provided formal training or welcomed by established gatekeepers — and in male-dominated fields, the support between women has long served as a kind of shadow academy, anointing and ushering in the next wave of talent. The concept of a mentorship, though, as seen in the examples below, is widely variable. Some mentors are also friends, though a close connection is not always necessary. Sometimes, all it takes is a word of encouragement at the right time to alter the course of cultural history.

Judy Chicago (b. 1939) and Anaïs Nin (1903-77)

When Judy Chicago met Anaïs Nin at a party in the summer of 1971, she had just finished reading Nin’s diary, which became a sensation among American women for its frank discussions of sex, psychoanalysis and ambition. Chicago, then 32, had recently published a revealing essay of her own, entitled “My Struggle as a Woman Artist.” “It was the first time I had ever tried to write about it,” she says. She was floored when Nin walked up and told her how much she had enjoyed it. At the time, Chicago was paralyzed by the volume of her own ideas. “Anaïs gave me this incredible piece of advice. She said: ‘You can’t live out all these possibilities. But you can write your way through them. You should write a book.’” That was the push Chicago needed to write her 1975 autobiography, “Through the Flower”; Nin wrote the introduction. According to Chicago, they only disagreed on one thing: the value of anger. “She didn’t think it was appropriate,” Chicago says. “I felt the opposite.”

Misty Copeland (b. 1982) and Raven Wilkinson (1935-2018)

Misty Copeland was already almost a decade into her career at the American Ballet Theater when she first became aware of Raven Wilkinson’s existence. One night in 2010 at home, she was watching the 2005 documentary “Ballets Russes,” half-paying attention, when, out of the corner of her eye, she saw a woman of color auditioning before a row of white men. That woman was Raven Wilkinson, the first Black ballerina in the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. As it turns out, the two lived a block apart in New York City. Wilkinson, who danced with a white ballet company before fleeing the segregated South for Europe in the 1950s, would become Copeland’s mentor until her death in 2018. In her 2022 memoir, “The Wind at My Back,” Copeland writes, “Raven taught me through her example that, as they say, ‘When and where I enter, the whole race enters with me’ is not a burden and a pressure but a promise of possibility.”

Doris Lessing (1919-2013) and Jenny Diski (1947-2016)

Warmth and encouragement did not define the relationship between the writers Doris Lessing and Jenny Diski. The Nobel Prize-winning author invited the then-15-year-old Diski to live with her in London on the suggestion of her son, who was Diski’s boarding-school classmate. Fleeing abusive parents, Diski was immediately seduced by the house’s consistency, stocked fridge and churn of visiting intellectuals. She knew she wanted to be a writer. But during the four years they lived together, Lessing never offered notes or advice; anything Diski learned was through observation and osmosis. The two made a pact never to write about each other — and, fittingly, both broke their word. Diski-like characters appear in Lessing’s novels “Memoirs of a Survivor” (1974) and “The Sweetest Dream” (2001). After Lessing’s death in 2013 and Diski’s own terminal cancer diagnosis, she wrote “In Gratitude” (2016), a brutal memoir about their relationship. “There was no hope of ever being right,” Diski writes, “as Doris was right.”

Kathy Acker (1947-97) and Karen Finley (b. 1956)

The term “mentor” is a bit too clinical and hierarchical to fully encapsulate Karen Finley’s relationship with Kathy Acker. The pathbreaking artists met in the late 1970s, when Acker was a visiting teacher and Finley was a grad student at the San Francisco Art Institute. “Boundaries in the classroom weren’t the same as they are now,” Finley says. On the first day of class, Finley went to Acker’s home; they attended parties, readings and performances together. For Finley, grad school was about being inducted into a vocation — first as a student, then as a colleague and finally as a friend and co-conspirator. Acker offered that. She also encouraged Finley, who is now a professor at N.Y.U.’s Tisch School for the Arts, to pursue experimental, dislocated writing alongside performance. Acker’s “belief that, as a woman at that time, I was expected to be talented, that I would be a contributor, was very meaningful to me,” Finley says, “and I think it’s also a reason I am in education today.”

Pat Parker (1944-89) and Audre Lorde (1934-92)

Parker and Lorde’s relationship was part-mentorship, part-sisterhood. Over the course of 15 years, the pair exchanged letters (Parker lived in Oakland, Calif., and Lorde, New York) about poetry, activism, Black lesbian identity and motherhood. Each paid tribute to the other in her work, including Parker’s poem “For Audre,” in which she wrote: “My muse sang of you— / watch the sky for / an ebony meteorite / that will pierce / into your darkness / illuminate your fears / hurl them at you / laughing.” They also supported each other through treatment for breast cancer, with which they were diagnosed almost 10 years apart (Lorde in 1977, Parker in 1988). Upon learning of Parker’s illness, Lorde wrote: “You are a survivor, Pat, and that battle on a physical level is now braided into our lives, but the war is not alien, now is it? You and me we’ve been fighting all our lives.” Their intimate correspondence is captured in the 2018 book​ “Sister Love: The Letters of Audre Lorde and Pat Parker 1974-1989.”

Joni Mitchell (b. 1943) and Brandi Carlile (b. 1981)

Brandi Carlile first heard Joni Mitchell’s music when she was in her 20s. She didn’t love it. Still coming to terms with her queerness, she felt Mitchell’s songs were too feminine to resonate with her. But when Carlile’s wife, Catherine Shepherd, reintroduced her to the music a few years later, it hit differently. Mitchell’s songs helped her realize “I had spent too long equating vulnerability and weakness with femininity,” Carlile wrote in the Times of London. In 2018, three years after Mitchell suffered a life-threatening brain aneurysm, Carlile performed at her 75th birthday concert. After Mitchell mentioned how much she missed hearing her own instruments played, Carlile began organizing Joni Jams, monthly jam sessions at Mitchell’s Bel Air home. It was these freewheeling gatherings that encouraged the 79-year-old icon to return to the stage. She surprised the world (and her own band) when she took the mic alongside Carlile at the Newport Folk Festival last summer. What started out as a star-studded tribute set transitioned — at first tentatively, then enthusiastically, with grins, tears and a roaring audience — into Mitchell’s first full-blown live performance in 20 years.

Yayoi Kusama (b. 1929) and Georgia O’Keeffe (1887-1986)

“If she had not so kindly answered my clumsy and reckless letter to her, I am not sure I would ever have made it to America,” the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama told the Tate of the painter Georgia O’Keeffe. “I knew that only in New York could I become a star.” The two artists, born 42 years apart, met only once in person. But as a young artist in Matsumoto, Kusama came across O’Keeffe’s work in a book and boldly wrote to ask her advice. Intrigued by the Japanese return address, O’Keeffe replied — and encouraged Kusama to move to New York and show her work to “anyone” who might be interested. Over the years, the elder artist repeatedly invited Kusama to visit her in New Mexico. Kusama always declined.

Frida Kahlo (1907-54) and Fanny Rabel (1922-2008)

Frida Kahlo did not teach people how to paint. Instead, as her student Fanny Rabel told Kahlo’s biographer Hayden Herrera, she taught them how to live and how to look. Rabel was the only female member of Los Fridos, a group of four artists who studied with Kahlo until her death at the age of 47. (The others were Arturo Garcia Bustos, Guillermo Monroy and Arturo Estrada.) Kahlo sought out opportunities for her protégés, like a commission to paint the exterior of La Rosita, a tavern down the street from her Mexico City home and studio, Casa Azul. Rabel — a Polish Jewish artist who moved to the capital as a teenager — also assisted Kahlo’s husband, Diego Rivera, on his famed murals for the National Palace. With a particular interest in depicting Indigenous women and families, Rabel became the most prominent woman in the otherwise macho Mexican Muralist movement.

Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1806-61) and Mary Russell Mitford (1787-1855)

Sometimes the mentee’s legacy eclipses that of the mentor. This was the case with the Victorian poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Mary Russell Mitford, a then-established chronicler of rural English life almost 20 years Browning’s senior. Mitford served as a maternal figure to Browning, coaching her through the publication of her book “The Seraphim, and Other Poems” (1838) and supporting her as she grieved the deaths of two of her brothers in close succession. (In addition to arranging flower deliveries, Mitford reportedly gave Browning one of her own spaniel’s puppies.) Their relationship wasn’t without disputes — Mitford wasn’t an immediate fan of Elizabeth’s husband, the poet Robert Browning, and Elizabeth was scandalized that, after her brother died, Mitford wrote about his accidental drowning in the book “Recollections of a Literary Life” (1852). But they remained close until Mitford’s death in 1855.

Rosalba Carriera (1673-1757) and Felicità Sartori (circa 1714-60)

It was unusual to be a female artist in the 18th century; it was even more unusual to be a wildly successful one. But Rosalba Carriera, nicknamed the Queen of Pastel, was sought after by kings and aristocrats across Europe. Raised in Venice, she never married and developed a flourishing, all-female studio that specialized in selling miniatures (which sometimes bordered on erotica) to Grand Tour travelers. She was also famously generous with other female artists, offering support, training and encouragement. One of her favorite apprentices was Felicità Sartori, who executed both pastels and miniatures, frequently making copies of Carriera’s work for sale. Sartori also posed for her mentor; a circa 1740 portrait in which she dons a Turkish-inspired robe and a flirty smirk is now in the collection of the Uffizi.

    "45" : """ Naomi Watts: Elle impressed me the first time we met [while making the 2015 film “3 Generations,” in which Watts plays the mother of Fanning’s character]. She was 16, but with such emotional intelligence. When I was trying to get my start in my late 20s, I was already being told I was too late. They said, “You’d better get going. You’ve got only seconds left!” I think that’s changed — for the better, obviously. We’re now seeing women in their 50s carry films. There even seems to be a bit more movement in the opposite direction, like aging is suddenly trending.

With women, but never with men, “ambition” always gets labeled an ugly word. I’ve always been hungry, and that’s what got me here. I spent many years under the radar, not getting jobs — just tiny bits here and there — until David Lynch gave me an incredible role [in 2001’s “Mulholland Dr.”]. Had I not maintained that level of determination or ambition, whatever you want to call it, I would have packed it in and just tried to find something else. Knowing why you love what you do is important. What’s feeding you that makes you keep coming back for more?

Elle Fanning: Naomi’s kind of genre-less; it’s her own path that she’s forged. That’s what I hope people will one day say about my work. I always want to surprise people and push against what they think I can do.

When I was shooting the first season of “The Great” [the Hulu series that premiered in 2020, and that will soon air its third season, with Fanning playing Catherine the Great], it was also my first time producing a show. I hadn’t been behind the scenes much before, making those decisions, but I’d always been curious about how everything’s put together. Now I can feel myself evolving, not being as afraid to speak up in rooms that I wouldn’t normally be in. I’m still young, but I keep having to remind myself, “You’ve been acting since you were 2 — you’ve been on a lot of film sets, and you’ve seen a lot of things.”

    "46" : """ Cheryl “Salt” James: I remember Issa creating a Kickstarter account in 2011 to raise money so she could finish the first season of her YouTube series “The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl” (2011-13). That always struck me as savvy and bold. I had the privilege of watching her build her audience, then take them with her to HBO for “Insecure.”

When you’re an artist, people are always questioning your vision. Ideas can get stretched and pulled in different directions, and they can become diluted. Issa has always, from what I can see, followed her gut.

Sandra “Pepa” Denton: In her memoir [2015’s “The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl”], Issa mentions struggling with not feeling Black enough. I can relate to that. When Salt-N-Pepa was selling millions of records, they called us “crossover,” which meant that we weren’t Black or hip enough. Now everyone wants to be pop. It means you’ve gone global. Like us, Issa stayed strong and was smart about her struggle, turning it into comedy. She kept it real, too.

Issa Rae: I grew up on Salt-N-Pepa. I’ve always admired their collaboration as partners and the way they complement each other. It’s so hard for a group to last in this business, but they continue to be unapologetic about who they are and what they’re about. So much of my inspiration as a writer comes from female rappers. I write to rap music. When I was in middle school, I even tried to start rap groups because of Salt-N-Pepa. I had no business doing that, but they made me think I could.

I found my voice as an artist when, as a teenager, I realized I could tell stories that either made people laugh or feel something. With my web series “The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl,” there’s so much of me on camera — my sensibilities and sense of humor are on full display — and having the validation of that being what launched my career was both so scary and fulfilling. It took me a while to realize that it was my voice I was introducing to the world.

    "47" : """ In Eoghan Walls’s THE GOSPEL OF ORLA (236 pp., Seven Stories, paperback, $16.95), the flinty 14-year-old protagonist runs away from home and finds God — in the form of a “mad hairy” guy wrapped in a blanket who steals her bike. Enraged and afraid, she pulls a pocketknife and demands his name.

“Jesus?” she asks, when he tells her. “Jesus bloody Jesus like the Jesus Jesus?” He nods.

Her bike gone, Orla must return home to her widowed father and toddler sister in the North England village of Glasson Dock. But she’s determined to hatch a new plan. It’s unfair that her grieving dad gets to do what he wants, which is drink; what Orla wants is to steal and skip class and get out of there. When Jesus returns her bike, she shows him how to use an iPhone — he pokes and scrolls, transfixed — and it turns out he’s the real deal: a genuine miracle-worker who raises her cat from the dead. She sees possibility. She persuades him to run off to Ireland with her and try to resurrect her mom.

As coming-of-age stories go, “The Gospel of Orla” is winningly off-kilter. Walls refuses easy sentimentality, and the story is brisk and surprising, perfectly paced. Orla’s irreverence is beguiling — “Everyone was all so nicey nice after Mum died even Suzie B who is a two-face slag” — and her sense of injustice buoying. We don’t live forever: Orla is right to find this deeply messed up. Walls’s marvelous novel asks what we might look for by way of consolation. A miracle shouldn’t be too much to ask.

“Forget what you know about mermaids,” beseeches teenage Ren, the narrator of Jade Song’s debut, CHLORINE (237 pp., Morrow, $30). “You think mermaids have no power.” To be fish-bodied, Ren insists, is to be almighty.

Song’s harrowing novel subverts the standards of merfolk lore — clamshell bras, underwater kingdoms, the love of a sailor or prince. “For too long you’ve been inundated by G-rated fairy tales,” Ren says. She is not beneficent or seductive; she’s ruthless and mutilated.

When she’s still human, the fastest on her swim team and the favorite of her lascivious coach, Ren is lonely. Her dad returns to China to build a business: “What is it called when immigrants reverse,” Ren wonders, “when they wake up from the nightmare masked as a dream?” Ren asks when he’ll come back, and he promises, “As soon as you go under a minute in the 100 freestyle.” Ren’s mom exerts pressure, too, urging her to impress Ivy League recruiters.

Ren finds a friend in Cathy, who, in a splendidly uncomfortable moment, helps her insert a tampon. Cathy alone treasures Ren whether she wins or loses, has two legs or a tail. Cathy’s love letters to Ren, overwrought in that adolescent way, are threaded throughout the book.

Her mind warped by stress, Ren decides the only way to be the best is to transform herself. Her metamorphosis is horrifying, but only for the reader: “Mermaids relish pain,” she says. Change requires a little agony, Ren shows us. Delusion, too.

“The mermaid has to die,” a screenwriter tells Penny, the narrator of Julia Langbein’s sublime AMERICAN MERMAID (329 pp., Doubleday, $28), who has also written a novel called “American Mermaid.” Penny has left Connecticut and a low-paid teaching job she loved to make a go of it in Hollywood, adapting her surprise best seller for the screen. Killing Sylvia, her formidable mermaid protagonist, would be a major departure from her novel.

The show’s writers have also decided they need to eroticize the asexual Sylvia. “There’s just no way to sexualize a fish,” Penny tells them. “She’s going to have to win your interest some other way.” The writers — both men — are pigheaded and tactless; their conversations with Penny are very funny. In an extended, riotous text thread about merfolk sex, they somehow bring in Saoirse Ronan, Ina Garten and “semen soup.” Their humiliating proposed tagline for the trailer: “FIRST. WAVE. FEMINISM.”

Langbein intertwines Penny’s story with chapters from her own novel, and this book-within-a-book structure allows us to mourn the gap between the novel Penny has written and the version she’s told will make a good movie. (“It’s my story,” she bemoans to her shark of an agent. “Not really,” the agent responds. “You sold it.”) The writers confront Penny about major changes made to the master script; Penny, who can’t account for them, starts to suspect Sylvia has come alive to edit the screenplay and reclaim her fate. Langbein’s novel considers how we decide who owns a story — and, far more compelling, how we know when a story succeeds.

The epigraph for Anna Metcalfe’s eerie and mesmerizing debut, CHRYSALIS (259 pp., Random House, $27), comes from Vladimir Nabokov, who was obsessed with butterflies. After emerging from the cocoon, Nabokov writes, “the butterfly sees the world, the large and awful face of the gaping entomologist.” The comma is suggestive: For the watched, the watcher is both of the world, and the world itself.

Metcalfe splits her novel among three first-person narrators, each of whom closely observes the same unnamed woman — a fitness influencer who posts “Still Life” videos in which she holds poses for hours. The first vantage point is Elliot’s: He goes to her gym and watches her lift weights, entranced by her self-possession. We hear, too, from the woman’s mother, Bella, who recounts how badly she wanted her mercurial daughter to need her when she was younger. The final section belongs to the influencer’s friend Susie, who helped the woman through a bad breakup, and now watches her videos and reads all the comments.

“Do you really need the people in your life,” the woman asks her followers, “or do they need you?” She advocates radical solitude: “Cut yourself off.” People go wild for the excuse to be selfish in the name of self-care. The woman coins hokey terms like “lonefulness” and “alonement,” and soon her followers start disappearing: They give up their lives and take to the woods to seek quiet and stillness.

“Chrysalis” is a thrilling look at how we spin silk around ourselves by watching the world on our screens. We are the gaping entomologist; we are the pupa, always a little stuck.

    "48" : """ Howardena Pindell: Melissa uses the techniques of traditional Navajo weaving, but then she does something that I can’t even imagine being able to do: She weaves intuitively, so the pattern is born as she works. My art has a lot of minutiae, like hers, and another connection is that the pieces she makes are often associated with Germantown Revival-style blankets [originally woven from yarn sent from mills in Germantown, Pa., to the Navajo reservations in the mid-19th century]. I grew up in Germantown during Jim Crow. It was not what you’d call an ideal place to be if you were of color.

Melissa is someone whose ancestors, whose nation, have been through hell. It was much worse than the plight of Black people in Germantown. It was actually Asiba Tupahache, a member of the Matinecoc Nation and activist from Long Island, who unlocked the part of my brain that was speechless but still feeling the hurt of racism. Hearing her speak the way she did about how Indigenous people were treated helped me find my own voice.

Melissa Cody: I started looking at Howardena’s paintings because the color theory behind her compositions is just so eye-catching and evokes so much emotion. I was really grasping for how to incorporate layers of emotion through color in my own textiles. I work on a traditional Navajo loom, so once a piece is complete, I can’t go back and remake it. It’s in its final state. I really appreciate Howardena’s work because it also has that sense of completion and finality. You can see when she’s able to call her piece finished.

I’m a fifth-generation textile artist. My career has been fostered not only by my relatives — my aunts, my mother, my grandmothers and my great-grandmothers — but also by other women who’re weavers in the Navajo Nation. Learning from family, you feel the ambience of such a wealth of knowledge. I was very, very lucky to have been around that. Now, my generation is taking weaving to the next path — bringing it into a fine-art setting, and also using it as a tool to teach our people’s history.
